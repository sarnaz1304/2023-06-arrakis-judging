# Vault mint rules can be bypassed by directly interacting with the vault itself

## Summary

The ArrakisV2Router inherits a few functionalities from [ArrakisV2RouterStorage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2RouterStorage.sol) that are used for:
- pausing/unpausing the adding and removal of liquidity from a vault
- whitelisting and blacklisting addresses who can use a vault
- setting a supply cap on the pool shares that can ever be minted for an ArrakisV2 vault

When the router is used it indeed enforces these rules when it comes to adding liquidity. But the vaults themselves have their minting functionality external and do not take into account the rules set out for themselves in the router.

## Vulnerability Detail

Vault minting rules are only enforced within the ArrakisV2Router and are not taken into account within the vaults themselves.

## Impact

I haven't been able to spend much time examining the possible impact but from first sight that'd be:
- pausing the interaction with a vault is only imaginary
- same goes for blacklisting addresses. The minting in a vault is either restricted entirely for all but 1 addresses, or it's wide open for everybody.
- minting beyond the supply cap set out in the router

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Extract the checks performed in [ArrakisV2Router#_addLiquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L414-L427) to a separate function and use it in the ArrakisV2 contract itself or just introduce a similar type of safety check mechanism in the vault itself prior to minting.
