# Missing round and positive price checks in Chainlink

## Summary

`latestRoundData` may return stale/wrong data, and there are some checks that are missing to ensure that this doesn't happen.

## Vulnerability Detail

In ChainLinkOracle there is only a check to avoid timestamp staleness, but some checks are missing (round complete and positive price):

```solidity
try priceFeed.latestRoundData() returns (
            uint80,
            int256 price,
            uint256,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80
        ) {
            require(
                block.timestamp - updatedAt <= outdated, // solhint-disable-line not-rely-on-time
                "ChainLinkOracle: outdated."
            );
```

The first `uint80` variable indicates the `roundId` which may not have ended yet, but this isn't checked. The price could also be zero or negative if it wasn't updated yet, but this isn't checked.

## Impact

Medium as it is a rare occurrence, but if it happens it may cause a loss of funds if the price is negative and/or the round has not ended yet, as the price would be stale.

## Recommendation

Consider adding the following checks:

```solidity
try priceFeed.latestRoundData() returns (
            uint80 roundId,
            int256 price,
            uint256,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) {

    //@audit negative price check is considered an invalid price
    require(price > 0, "Negative Oracle Price");
    //@audit round completed check
    require(roundId >= answeredInRound, "Round not complete");
    ...
```
