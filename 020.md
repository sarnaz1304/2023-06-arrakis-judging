# OOG for unbound loop for `_ranges` leads to stuck funds in vault

## Summary
If the length of the array `_ranges` in `ArrakisV2.sol` gets to long the function `burn` will run out of gas and users will not be able to withdraw any funds


## Vulnerability Detail
If a user wants to withdraw his assets from a vault, he calls the function `burn` in `ArrakisV2.sol`. This function iterates over the array of `_ranges` and proportionally burns liquidity in each `range` the vault is invested in. If the number of ranges is to big, the function will run out of gas and the user will not be able to withdraw his assets.  

## Impact
If users can not withdraw their assets at any time, the reputation of Arrakis will be damaged and user will not deposit additional funds into other vaults and will move the funds they have already deposited to other projects.

## Recommendation

Limit the number of ranges a vault can enter to prevent this issue
