# Non-whitelisted users can still add liquidity to vault.

## Summary
When a vault only allows whitelisted users to add liquidity and mint shares, this is implemented in ArrakisV2Router.sol instead of the core vault contract ArrakisV2.sol. This allows non-whitelisted users to bypass restrictions and interact directly through ArrakisV2.sol.
## Vulnerability Detail
A vault can be set up to only allow whitelisted users to mint and have their assets managed. This is implemented in `_addLiquidity()` in ArrakisV2Router.sol. 
```solidity
//ArrakisV2Router.sol-_addLiquidity()
...
            if (mintRules.hasWhitelist) {
                require(
                    _mintWhitelist[vault_].contains(msg.sender),
                    "not whitelisted"
                );
            }
...
```
However, a non-whitelisted user can directly mint liquidity through ArrakisV2.sol-mint(), where there is not check on whether msg.sender is whitelisted, nor there is a variable to hold whitelisted users. The malicious user can still implement all slippage control in a malicious contract.
## Impact
Non-whitelisted users can mint in a restricted vault which unfairly reduces the percentage vault shares of whitelisted users, causing whitelisted users to have to deposit more tokens to add the same amount of liquidity, and claim less profits from the pool.  Non-whitelisted users also unfairly benefit from the exclusive rebalancing strategy of the vault. 

I think this is high severity because of how easily and with no cost a crucial restriction can bypassed, and the whitelisted minters will definitely lose profits.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the white-listed user array variable in the core ArrakisV2.sol instead of the router contract, such that ArrakisV2Router.sol would query the core vault for the whitelist during minting, and also that when any user minting directly through ArrakisV2.sol , `mint()` will check msg.sender against the white list when it is not from the router contract.
