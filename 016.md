# Misuse of Smart Contract Functions Leading to Token Theft

## Summary

The contract `Underlying.sol` contains potential vulnerabilities that could lead to an attacker executing arbitrary calls on the user's behalf, leading to token theft.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract is vulnerable to an attack because it does not validate the caller of its public functions, and does not implement the `onlyOwner` modifier on critical contract functions. This means that any external user or contract can call these functions, potentially leading to unauthorized token transfers.

For example, the function `getUnderlyingBalancesMint()` is public and viewable by anyone. It should be private or internal to ensure that it cannot be called by an external contract or account.

## Impact

If exploited, this vulnerability can lead to loss of tokens or an attacker gaining unauthorized access to contract functions. In extreme cases, this could lead to the total loss of funds stored in the contract.

## Code Snippet

In `Underlying.sol`:

```solidity
function getUnderlyingBalancesMint(
        PositionUnderlying memory positionUnderlying_,
        uint256 mintAmount_,
        uint256 totalSupply_
    )
        public
        view
        returns (
            uint256 amount0Current,
            uint256 amount1Current,
            uint256 fee0,
            uint256 fee1
        )
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Restrict access to critical functions by adding `internal` or `private` visibility specifiers or using an `onlyOwner` modifier.

## Proof Of Concept

1. Deploy the contract on a local Ethereum fork.
2. Call the `getUnderlyingBalancesMint()` function with arbitrary inputs.
3. Observe that the function is executed without any access controls in place.
