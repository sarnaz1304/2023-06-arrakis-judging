# repeated rebalances lets an operator steal funds

## Summary
An operator can abuse the swaps in `rebalance` with repetedly taking the full `maxSlippage`

## Vulnerability Detail

### Background
When an operator does a `rebalance` there are a couple of checks that they aren't abusing swaps to do unfavorable trades for the stakers in the vault:

First there is a check that the `amountIn` and `expectedMinReturn` are reasonably set according to an oracle price:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-manager-templates/contracts/SimpleManager.sol#L318-L354
```solidity
File: v2-manager-templates/contracts/SimpleManager.sol

318:    function _checkMinReturn(
319:        Rebalance memory rebalanceParams_,
320:        IOracleWrapper oracle_,
321:        uint24 maxSlippage,
322:        uint8 decimals0,
323:        uint8 decimals1
324:    ) internal view {
325:        if (rebalanceParams_.swap.zeroForOne) {
326:            require(
327:                FullMath.mulDiv(
328:                    rebalanceParams_.swap.expectedMinReturn,
329:                    10 ** decimals0,
330:                    rebalanceParams_.swap.amountIn
331:                ) >
332:                    FullMath.mulDiv(
333:                        oracle_.getPrice0(),
334:                        hundred_percent - maxSlippage, // <-- can be up to 10%
335:                        hundred_percent
336:                    ),
337:                "S0"
338:            );
339:        } else {
                ... // same but in other direction
353:        }
354:    }
```

`maxSlippage` here can be up to 10% but must at least cover the fee of trading in the pool so cannot be 0.

Then there's a check that this price `expectedMinReturn` and `amountIn` are used when doing the actual rebalance:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L341-L363
```solidity
File: v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol

341:            if (rebalanceParams_.swap.zeroForOne) {
342:                require(
343:                    (balance1After >=
344:                        balance1Before +
345:                            rebalanceParams_.swap.expectedMinReturn) &&
346:                        (balance0After >=
347:                            balance0Before - rebalanceParams_.swap.amountIn),
348:                    "SF"
349:                );
350:                balance0After = balance0Before - balance0After;
351:                balance1After = balance1After - balance1Before;
352:            } else {
                    ... // same in other direction
363:            }
```

### The attack
An operator can perform as many rebalances in the same tx as they want, as long as they are done serially because the slippage checks are only done within the same call to `rebalance`.

To keep the math simple, imagine this scenario:

A vault with 10% `maxSlippage` has 100 `token0` (including fees), `token1`/`2` price is 1:1.

An operator calls rebalance. Withdraws the full amount from the liquidity staking. The vault now has 100 token0, 100 token1.
`amountIn` is 100 and `expectedMinReturn` is 90.
When doing the swap, the operator instead of swapping 100 -> 90 they do two swaps (using `multicall` on uni router), 90 t0 -> 90 t1 for the vault, and 10 t0 -> 10 t1 with themselves as recipient.
They then iterate this back and forth always transferring the `maxSlippage` equivalent amount to themselves. 

Depending on how high `maxSlippage` is this can take longer or shorter, but `maxSlippage` must at least cover the fees of the pool and a little bit to allow trading hence this attack is always possible.

There are other variants of this that are more complex,  a flashloan could be used to provide JIT liquidity to a tight price range, then do multiple swaps within this range to take the `maxSlippage` equivalent amount as fees instead. Or do price manipulation within `maxDeviation` or a combination. The attack vector here is that you can repeatedly steal `maxSlippage` over a lot of calls to `rebalance`.

## Impact
An operator can use multiple trades to empty the vault of funds to fees when swapping.

Operators are stated to be semi-trusted:
> Operators are "semi trusted" only to be awake and adhere to the expected vault rebalancing strategy. Thus a malicious operator on the SimpleManager.sol should not be able to do anything worse than "grief" - they MAY not execute rebalances or MAY not execute the expected strategy. However the rebalances that are executed MUST NOT be exploitable by frontrun or sandwich.

Above is a sample of an attack where an operator abusing rebalance can steal a lot of value. As long as the `maxSlippage` equivalent amount is greater than the gas fee this is profitable.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Considering adding a cooldown period for rebalances. Then multiple rebalances cannot be performed in the same tx. That limits this attack and can give the protocol time to notice the abuse and remove the bad operator. This could possibly be limited per operator so that a single operator can only rebalance once an hour or something. That would enable fast rebalance given multiple operators but no single operator can abuse rebalances as described above.
