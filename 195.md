# Vulnerable token transfers and external function calls in ArrakisV2.sol rebalance() function

## Summary
The ArrakisV2.sol contract contains vulnerabilities related to token transfers and external function calls, which could result in loss of funds or manipulation of the contract's state. These vulnerabilities primarily arise from interactions with Uniswap V3 pools and the use of external contracts without proper validation.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Token Transfers: The contract interacts with Uniswap pools through the mint and burn functions, which could involve token transfers. However, the contract does not explicitly perform token transfers in a secure manner. This could lead to incorrect balance tracking, unauthorized access, or loss of funds if the transfers are not properly handled.
Also the `rebalance()` function involves multiple operations, including calculations, token transfers, and checks. If these operations are not performed in the correct order or sequence, it may result in incorrect calculations, incorrect token transfers, or failure to check certain conditions. For example, if the checks for minimum returns or deviations are performed after token transfers, it may lead to unintended consequences, such as loss of funds or incorrect rebalancing actions.

- Pool Validation: The rebalance function retrieves the address of Uniswap V3 pools using the getPool function. However, it does not validate the pool's existence, which could result in a null address or a malicious pool address being used in subsequent operations. This could disrupt the execution of the function or lead to malicious manipulation of the pool.

- Balance Checks: The contract lacks comprehensive balance checks within the rebalance function. Specifically, the checks for managerBalance0 and managerBalance1 should be strengthened to ensure that the contract's token balances are always sufficient to cover the manager balances. Insufficient balance checks could potentially allow unauthorized access or manipulation of funds.

- Arbitrary Router Contract Calls: The rebalance function allows a low-level call to interact with a router contract specified in the parameters. This introduces a critical risk as any arbitrary contract can be called, potentially executing arbitrary function calls on the vault contract. Malicious actors could exploit this to steal funds or manipulate the contract's state.

## Impact
The vulnerabilities review above can have significant impacts, including:

- Loss of funds through unauthorized transfers or manipulation of token balances.
- Disruption of the rebalance function's execution due to invalid or malicious pool addresses.
- Exploitation of arbitrary router contract calls to execute unauthorized function calls, leading to theft of funds or manipulation of the contract's state.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Implement secure token transfers by ensuring proper balance checks, handling of returned tokens, and validation of token transfer functions.
- Validate the existence and integrity of Uniswap V3 pools retrieved using the getPool function.
- Strengthen balance checks within the rebalance function to ensure sufficient token balances for manager operations.
- Implement stricter validation or restriction of the router contract to trusted contracts only.
- Carefully handle the return values of external function calls.
- Ensuring the proper order of operations in the rebalance() function.
