# XO-The variable `name`  is not initialized if the `getTokenName` function fails.

## Summary
- The `getTokenName` function fails, the name variable is not initialized and the initialize function will be called with an empty name. This could cause the initialize function to fail, which would prevent the vault from being deployed.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function _preDeploy(InitializePayload calldata params_, bool isBeacon_)
        internal
        returns (address vault)
    {
        (address token0, address token1) = _getTokenOrder(
            params_.token0,
            params_.token1
        );

        string memory name = "Arrakis Vault V2";
        try this.getTokenName(token0, token1) returns (string memory result) {
            name = result;
        } catch {} // solhint-disable-line no-empty-blocks

        bytes memory data = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            IArrakisV2.initialize.selector,
            name,
            string(abi.encodePacked("RAKISv2-", _uint2str(numVaults() + 1))),
            params_
        );

        bytes32 salt = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(tx.origin, block.number, data)
        );

        vault = isBeacon_
            ? address(
                new BeaconProxy{salt: salt}(address(arrakisV2Beacon), data)
            )
            : address(
                new TransparentUpgradeableProxy{salt: salt}(
                    arrakisV2Beacon.implementation(),
                    address(this),
                    data
                )
            );
    }
```
- The code tries to call the `getTokenName` function, but if the function fails, the `name` variable is not initialized and the initialize function will be called with an empty `name` This could cause the initialize function to fail, which would prevent the vault from being deployed.
## Impact
-The initialize function could fail, which would prevent the vault from being deployed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the `getTokenName` function should be wrapped in a `try/catch` block. This will ensure that the name variable is always initialized, even if the `getTokenName` function fails.
