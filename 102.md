# ArrakisV2Router._addLiquidity checks can be bypassed

## Summary
ArrakisV2Router._addLiquidity checks can be bypassed. User can interact with vault directly.
## Vulnerability Detail
`ArrakisV2Router._addLiquidity` function [adds some check for supply cap and allowed minters](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L414-L426).

But this actually doesn't make sense as user can bypass it by simply calling needed function through the vault directly.
## Impact
Check can be bypassed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Looks like vault should have whitelisted addresses if you need to support that.
