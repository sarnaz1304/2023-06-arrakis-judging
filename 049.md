# When liquidity is small, anyone can change weights for next depositors with a donation

## Summary
When liquidity is small, anyone can change weights for next depositors with a donation

## Vulnerability Detail
The weights which every range is provided liquidity proportionnally to, and computed in `standardRebalance`:

and are implicitely propagated to next deposits and redeems, because every mint and every burn keeps the proportions accross ranges:

Can be imbalanced by making a donation and providing liquidity directly on UniswapV3 on behalf of the vault, and making a large impact on the balancing especially when liquidity is small initially.

## Impact
Balance parameters (weights) for ranges are not respected, and users may lose yield due to this (liquidity is provided too far out of range).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow the rebalance to set weights explicitely in the vault, which are respected during mints and burns
