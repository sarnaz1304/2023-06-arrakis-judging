# XO-`_checkSequencer()` function allows attacker to bypass `sequencer` check after downtime.

## Summary
- The `_checkSequencer()` function in the `ChainLinkOracle` contract does not check if the grace period has passed after the sequencer is back up. This means that if the sequencer is down for a period of time, and then comes back up, the `_checkSequencer()` function will not revert, even if the grace period has not passed.
## Vulnerability Detail
- the vulnerability lies in the the _checkSequencer() function.
```solidity
 /// @dev only needed for optimistic L2 chain
    function _checkSequencer() internal view {
        (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, , ) = sequencerUptimeFeed
            .latestRoundData();

        require(answer == 0, "ChainLinkOracle: sequencer down");

        // Make sure the grace period has passed after the
        // sequencer is back up.
        require(
            block.timestamp - startedAt > GRACE_PERIOD_TIME, // solhint-disable-line not-rely-on-time, max-line-length
            "ChainLinkOracle: grace period not over"
        );
    }

```
 - The function is designed to check if the sequencer is up and running, and if it is not, the function should revert, the function does not check if the grace period has passed after the sequencer is back up. This means that if the sequencer is down for a period of time, and then comes back up, the `_checkSequencer()` function will not revert, even if the grace period has not passed.
## Impact
This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to make the contract believe that the sequencer is up and running, even if it is not. This could allow the attacker to perform malicious actions on the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the `_checkSequencer()` function should be updated to check if the grace period has passed. The following code shows how the function could be updated
