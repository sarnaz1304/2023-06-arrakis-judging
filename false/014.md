# Lack of Input Validation on addPools Function

## Summary

The function addPools in ArrakisV2Storage contract takes an array of uint24 (feeTiers) as input. It uses these values to retrieve pools from the UniswapV3Factory. However, there are no checks to ensure that these values are valid fee tiers. An attacker can pass invalid fee tier values which do not correspond to any pool, causing the factory.getPool function to return address(0) which is then added to the _pools set. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds when interacting with these non-existent pools.

## Vulnerability Detail

In ArrakisV2Storage contract, the function addPools takes an array of uint24 as input and uses these to retrieve pools from UniswapV3Factory. However, no checks are performed to ensure that these uint24 values correspond to valid fee tiers in UniswapV3Factory.

The function in question is as follows:

```solidity
function addPools(uint24[] calldata feeTiers_) external onlyOwner {
    _addPools(feeTiers_, address(token0), address(token1));
    emit LogAddPools(feeTiers_);
}
```

The _addPools function retrieves the pool addresses from UniswapV3Factory using these fee tiers and adds them to the _pools set:

```solidity
function _addPools(
    uint24[] calldata feeTiers_,
    address token0Addr_,
    address token1Addr_
) internal {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < feeTiers_.length; i++) {
        address pool = factory.getPool(
            token0Addr_,
            token1Addr_,
            feeTiers_[i]
        );

        require(pool != address(0), "ZA");
        require(!_pools.contains(pool), "P");

        _pools.add(pool);
    }
}
```

## Impact

The factory.getPool function will return address(0) for invalid fee tier values. This can cause unexpected behavior when these non-existent pools are interacted with. If the address(0) pool is interacted with in some way (e.g., funds are sent to it), these funds would be permanently locked and become inaccessible.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A possible solution is to include checks that validate the fee tier values before they are used to retrieve pools. This could be accomplished by maintaining a list of valid fee tiers and checking against this list whenever addPools function is called.

## Proof Of Concept

The following steps can be taken to reproduce the vulnerability:

1. Deploy the ArrakisV2Storage contract and initialize it with the necessary parameters.
2. Call the addPools function with an array of uint24 values that do not correspond to valid fee tiers in UniswapV3Factory.
3. Observe that the function completes without any errors, adding address(0) to the _pools set.
4. Now, any interaction with these non-existent pools will lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.
