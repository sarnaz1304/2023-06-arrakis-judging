# ArrakisV2 implementation can be destroyed leading to loss of all assets

## Summary
ArrakisV2 vault implementation can be destroyed leading to loss of all assets


## Vulnerability Detail
`ArrakisV2Factory` is Factory contract for deploying fractional ArrakisV2 vaults. The `ArrakisV2Factory` creates a single implementation of `ArrakisV2` and then creates a proxy to that implementation every time a new vault needs to be deployed, but don't initialize it, which means that anybody can initialize the contract to become the owner, and then destroy it by doing a delegate call to a function with the selfdestruct opcode.
When the base implementation is annihilated, all associated `ArrakisV2` vaults inevitably fall into a state of disuse. The situation is irrevocably permanent because of the absence of any built-in logic in the proxies to refresh the implementation. Consequently, the ability to call any function on any `ArrakisV2` vault is lost forever, rendering these vaults simply dead.


This is constructor() code in ArrakisV2FactoryStorage (the ArrakisV2Factory inherit ArrakisV2FactoryStorage):
```solidity
// ArrakisV2Factory constructor
constructor(IArrakisV2Beacon arrakisV2Beacon_)
  ArrakisV2FactoryStorage(arrakisV2Beacon_)
  {}

// ArrakisV2FactoryStorage constructor
constructor(IArrakisV2Beacon arrakisV2Beacon_) {
  arrakisV2Beacon = arrakisV2Beacon_;
}
```

As you can see it creates new ArrakisV2 contract and set the implementation variable, but it doesn't call initialize() function of that ArrakisV2.


#### Another vulnerable scenario related to `ArrakisV2` implementation:
The `ArrakisV2.sol contract` is provided on the attack vector surfaces where someone could everytime frontrun it by monitoring the mempool. The `initialize()` function can be called by anyone who monitors the mempool.
A malicious attacker could monitor the blockchain for bytecode that matches the `ArrakisV2 contract` or the `initialize()` function signature and frontrun the transaction to get ownership and manager roles of the contract. This act can be repeated in a way similar to a `Denial Of Service (DOS) attack`, effectively stopping contract deployment. This could lead to the failure of the project plan and result in unrecoverable gas costs.


## Impact
This is a critical bug, since ALL assets held by ALL ArrakisV2 vaults will be lost. There's no way to transfer them out and there's no way to run any function on any vault.

Also, there's no way to fix the current deployed contracts (modules and registry), since they all depend on the ArrakisV2Factory, and there's no way to update them to a different factory.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are two ways:
1. Add initialize() in ArrakisV2FactoryStorage.sol constructor
2. Add initialize() in ArrakisV2Storage.sol constructor (and make the initialize() function public instead of external)
