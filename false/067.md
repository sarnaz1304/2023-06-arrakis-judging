# Manager can front run owner if owner wants to replace him and steal 100% of the fees that are accumulated in the pool but have not been withdrawn yet

## Summary

If there is a dispute between the manger and the owner of the vault and the owner decides to replace the manager, the manager can increase the ` setManagerFeeBPS ` to 100%, call rebalance and steal all the fees that have not been yet withdrawn from the pool.


## Vulnerability Detail

If there is a dispute between the manager and the owner of the vault so far as that the owner decides to change the manger, the manger turns into an untrusted person. He can scan the mempool for the transaction where the manger removes him as manager of the vault, front run it and do the following:

1.	Call `setManagerFeeBPS` and set the `managerFeeBPS` to 100%
2.	Call `rebalance` with an array of burns over all ranges with the value of 0
a.	This will not burn any liquidity but recalculate the fees the range has earned so far
b.	Then the function `pool.collect` in `_withdraw` will be called and all earned fees will be send to the vault where 100% of them will be added to the `managerBalance0` and `managerBalance1`
c.	He calls `setManagerFeeBPS` again and sets the `managerFeeBPS` back to the old value so the owner does not get suspicious 

After that the transaction of the owner will send the old manager the `managerBalance0` and `managerBalance1` when changing the manager address


## Impact

The old manager steals fees from the users of the vault. Depending on the TVL of the vault and the last time the fees were withdrawn from each range this can accumulate to a significant amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The manger should not be able to call the `setManagerFeeBPS` and change the `ManagerFeeBPS`, only the owner should be able to do this.
