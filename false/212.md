# DoS of rebalance operation when L2 sequencer is down or restarted in less than a hour. Should be a way to pause L2 sequencer uptime feed check in case of emergency by oracle owner

## Summary
`ChainLinkOracle.getPrice0, getPrice1()` reverts if L2 sequencer is down or restarted in less than hour if sequencer uptime feed is set.  It might effectively DoS operation of rebalance.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function _checkSequencer() internal view {
        (, int256 answer, uint256 startedAt, , ) = sequencerUptimeFeed
            .latestRoundData();

        require(answer == 0, "ChainLinkOracle: sequencer down");

        // Make sure the grace period has passed after the
        // sequencer is back up.
        require(
            block.timestamp - startedAt > GRACE_PERIOD_TIME, // solhint-disable-line not-rely-on-time, max-line-length
            "ChainLinkOracle: grace period not over"
        );
    }
```

## Impact
In normal cases, it's good protection, but in emergency situations like volatile market conditions, oracle owner should be able to turn off L2 sequencer uptime feed protection.

## Recommendation
Oracle owner should be able to pause L2 sequencer check in case of emergency.
