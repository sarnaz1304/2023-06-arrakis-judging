# Chainlink's latestRoundData is not checked for round completeness

## Summary

No check for round completeness could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price. The functions rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected, sometimes can lead to fund loss.

## Vulnerability Detail

ChainLinkOracle.sol uses Chainlink's latestRoundData() function, but does not check for round completeness

```
        try priceFeed.latestRoundData() returns (
            uint80,
            int256 price,
            uint256,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80
        ) {
            require(
                block.timestamp - updatedAt <= outdated, // solhint-disable-line not-rely-on-time
                "ChainLinkOracle: outdated."
            );
```

## Impact

Stale price may be used.
