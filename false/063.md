# When owner of a vault changes the manager, the old manager misses out on already accumulated fees that are still in the pool

## Summary

When an owner changes the manager of a vault the current `managerBalance0` and `managerBalance1` are transferred to the old manager but not his share of the already accumulated fees in the pool that have not been withdrawn yet.


## Vulnerability Detail

To changes the manager of an vault, the owner calls the function `setManager()` from `ArrakisV2Srorage.sol`. This function transfers the accumulated `managerBalance0` and `managerBalance1` to the current manager and changes the `manager` variable to a new address. Thereby the old manager misses out on his share of the already accumulated fees in the pool that have not been withdrawn yet.

## Impact

The old manager misses out on his share of the alreaddy collected fees in the pool that have not been withdrawn yet and the new manager inherits this share without having to work for it

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Before the manager is changed, all ranges of the pool should be called with a burn request of 0. This would update the tokens owed for the position which then can be withdrawn by calling `collect` for the position. Once the fees have been collected the `managerBalances` in the vault can be updated and the old manager gets the fees he is owed
