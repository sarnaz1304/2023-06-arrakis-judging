# When changing a manager, pending fees are not collected, causing loss of rewards to the old manager

## Summary
When changing a manager, the current manager receives only fees that were collected from Uniswap pools. However, pending and accumulated fees remain uncollected. As a result, the current manager receives a reduced reward for managing a vault.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a manager is changed via [ArrakisV2Storage.setManager](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L209), `_withdrawManagerBalance` is called to withdraw accumulated collected swap fees to the current manager. This is done to ensure that the managers receive full rewards before they're changed. However, pending and accumulated fees are not collected from Uniswap pools and not withdrawn to the manager. In Uniswap V3, swap fees exist in different states:
1. pending fees are fees that have been collected from traders but haven't yet been accumulated (which happens when a position is [updated](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/Position.sol#L60-L76));
1. accumulated fees are added to the position's `tokensOwed0` and `tokensOwed1` when a position is [updated](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/libraries/Position.sol#L60-L76);
1. accumulated fees can be collected via a call to [UniswapV3Pool.collect](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L503-L510).

The `_withdrawManagerBalance` function withdraws only collected fees, ignoring the pending and the accumulated fees in Uniswap pools.
## Impact
Arrakis vault managers can lose a portion of rewards for managing vaults.
## Code Snippet
1. Changing a manager withdraw currently collected fees:
[ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L209-L213](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L209-L213)
1. Fees are collected when some liquidity is burned:
[ArrakisV2.sol#L433-L442](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L433-L442)
1. Pending and accumulated in Uniswap pools fees are not collected before fees are withdrawn:
[ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L274-L288](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L274-L288)
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
When changing a manager, consider collecting all pending and accumulated fees by:
1. calling `UniswapV3Pool.burn` with 0 liquidity (the third argument of the function);
1. calling `UniswapV3Pool.collect` afterwards;
1. and calling `ArrakisV2._applyFees` to share the fees with the manager.

For reference, consider the Uniswap's `NonfungiblePositionManager.collect` implementation: [NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L328-L367](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L328-L367).
