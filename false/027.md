# Withdraw DOS through unbounded _ranges array

## Summary
A malicious operator can prevent vault depositors from withdrawing their funds by stuffing the `_ranges` array.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious operator can call rebalance to provide dust amounts of liquidity on a very large number of ranges, to stuff the unbounded `_ranges` array in `ArrakisV2`:

This will cause a DOS for users trying to withdraw:

If the `_ranges` array is very large, they will encounter out of gas error, and be denied the withdrawal of their funds

## Impact
Funds are stuck, vault depositors are unable to withdraw;

## Recommendation
Bound the number of ranges which can be managed on a single vault.
