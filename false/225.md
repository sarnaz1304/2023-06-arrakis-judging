# Funds are drained due to reentrancy vulnerability

## Summary
In the swapAndAddLiquidity function, the token transfers are performed before updating the state variables or completing other critical operations, a malicious contract can exploit reentrancy vulnerabilities to manipulate the flow of execution and drain the contract's funds. Despite having a nonReentrant modifier in the function, reentrancy will occur because external function calls are made after the token transfers
## Vulnerability Detail
The swapAndAddLiquidity transfers tokens (amount0 and amount1) from the msg.sender to the contract using the safeTransferFrom function. These transfers are performed before updating the state variables or completing other critical operations.
After the token transfers, the _swapAndAddLiquidity function is called to perform additional operations and update the state variables.
If the _swapAndAddLiquidity function calls an external contract that can execute arbitrary code, including making calls back to the swapAndAddLiquidity function, a reentrancy attack will  occur 

## Impact
An attacker can create a malicious contract then recursively call the swapAndAddLiquidity function before the state is updated, allowing them to manipulate the state and drain funds from the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern. In this case, the token transfers and critical operations should be performed after updating the state variables
