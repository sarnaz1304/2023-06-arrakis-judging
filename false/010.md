# Missing cap on `outdated` value in setOutdated function could lead to stale oracle data

## Summary
If the `outdated` set to 24 hours or more. The oracle date might be stale one. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In ChainLinkOracle.sol#setOutdated() and ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol#setOutdated(), `outdated` do not poses a upperLimit which means if the `outdated` set to high enough(say 24 hours). It could have devastating impact on the protocol, say token price fall very quickly during chainlink price feeds are stopped or not working.

Last year it happend with UST, when Chainlink paused it's oracle for it on around $0.20 but the price was much lower, resulting in loss of million dollars for some DeFi protocols. 

## Impact
Stale oracle data

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since the price of oracle could vary in the time gap of 3 hours, putting 3 hour cap could be less riskier. 

```solidity
    function setOutdated(uint256 outdated_) external onlyOwner {
        require(outdated_ <= 3 hours, "invalid beat");

        uint256 oldOutdated = outdated;
        outdated = outdated_;
        emit LogSetOutdated(address(this), oldOutdated, outdated_);
    }
```
