# Wrapped ether's deposit and withdraw(uint) functions do not work in some chains

## Summary
Wrapped ether's deposit and withdraw(uint) functions do not work in some chains

## Vulnerability Detail
See the Q&A section,

Q: On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
Mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB

Firstly, 

WETH does exist in Mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon only

Mainnet 
https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2#code

Arbitrum
https://arbiscan.io/token/0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1#code (Proxy)
https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8b194beae1d3e0788a1a35173978001acdfba668#code (Implementation)

Optimism
https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006#code

Polygon
https://polygonscan.com/token/0x7ceb23fd6bc0add59e62ac25578270cff1b9f619#code

But, you cannot find it in BNB

 [Note: The token in https://bscscan.com/token/0x4db5a66e937a9f4473fa95b1caf1d1e1d62e29ea is not from the official WETH company. You should see this

to make sure it is the official WETH like it appears in Abritirum, Optimism and Polygon
 ]

Secondly, 

Polygon's WETH does not have 

```weth.deposit{value: wethAmount}();``` function

It only have another similar function with has 1 more parameter. See

## Impact
WETH's functions that exist in the code cannot fully be applied to Polygon and BNB. And, therefore 

ArrakisV2Router#addLiquidity
ArrakisV2Router#swapAndAddLiquidity
ArrakisV2Router#removeLiquidity

will not work expectedly in Polygon and BNB

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
For Binance, don't deploy this protocol until WETH exists
For Polygon, use another alternative function to replace ```weth.deposit{value: wethAmount}();``` function
