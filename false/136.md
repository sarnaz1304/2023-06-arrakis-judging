# Pragma is not properly specified, which may result in a malfunctioning or corrupted contract when deployed on Arbitrum.

## Summary
Arbiturm is not compatible with version above 0.8.20, as result some contract may mal-function.

## Vulnerability Detail

• Pragma is set to ^0.8.0, which allows contracts to be compiled using any compiler above 0.8.0

• However, a challenge arises when deploying these contracts on Arbitrum.

• Arbitrum is not compatible with versions 0.8.20 and above,[ posing a compatibility issue](https://developer.arbitrum.io/solidity-support).

• Contracts compiled with these newer versions (0.8.20 and above) may not work properly.

• By default, the compiler utilises the newest version available, meaning that the code will be compiled with version 0.8.20 unless explicitly specified otherwise.

• Consequently, deploying code compiled with 0.8.20 on Arbitrum will produce broken functionality, deviating from the expected behaviour.

## Impact
Unexpected behaviour of smart contract functionality on Arbiturm.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Limit the pragma to 0.8.19

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <=0.8.19;
```
