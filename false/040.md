# Chainlink's latestRoundData return stale or incorrect result

## Summary
No check for round completeness could lead to stale prices and wrong price return value, or outdated price. The functions that rely on accurate price feed might not work as expected, which sometimes can lead to fund loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
The oracle wrapper [`getPrice0()`]() and [`getPrice1()`]() call out to an oracle with `latestRoundData()` to get the price of some token. Although the returned timestamp is checked, there is no check for round completeness.

Per Chainlink's [guidelines](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/historical-data), this function does not return an error if it can't reach an answer, instead, it either provides 0 or stale round data. The system's index price information is derived from an external Chainlink oracle, and this dependency on third-party data sources carries inherent risks. For instance, the oracle could lag behind or fail to be updated, causing outdated information to be used in index price computations. In the past, reliance on oracles has led to the malfunctioning of on-chain systems, and these issues can be triggered by something as commonplace as network congestion.

The same problem is in `_getLatestRoundData()` function in `ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol`

## Impact
- Incorrect liquidation
- Potential liquidation of users who shouldn't be liquidated
- Failure to perform liquidation when necessary
- Inaccurate price feed data

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate data feed for round completeness:

```solidity
try priceFeed.latestRoundData() returns (
            uint80 roundID,
            int256 price,
            uint256 timestamp,
            uint256 updatedAt, 
            uint80
        ) {

        //Solution
        require(updatedAt >= roundID, "Stale price");
        require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
        require(price > 0,"Chainlink answer reporting 0");

            require(
                block.timestamp - updatedAt <= outdated, // solhint-disable-line not-rely-on-time
                "ChainLinkOracle: outdated."
            );

            uint8 priceFeedDecimals = priceFeed.decimals();
            if (!_isPriceFeedInversed) {
                return
                    FullMath.mulDiv(
                        FullMath.mulDiv(
                            10 ** (2 * priceFeedDecimals),
                            10 ** token0Decimals,
                            SafeCast.toUint256(price)
                        ),
                        1,
                        10 ** priceFeedDecimals
                    );
            }
            return
                FullMath.mulDiv(
                    SafeCast.toUint256(price),
                    10 ** token0Decimals,
                    10 ** priceFeedDecimals
                );
        } catch {
            revert("ChainLinkOracle: price feed call failed.");
        }
```
