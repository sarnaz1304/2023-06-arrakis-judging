# ArrakisV2.sol : `rebalance` would try to use more `burn.liquidity` than the pool's liquidity which would lead to reverting the function call from uniswap side

## Summary

[rebalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L244C60-L244C60) takes struct of [Rebalance ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/structs/SArrakisV2.sol#L30)param which has an array of burns and mints.

struct Rebalance {
    PositionLiquidity[] burns;
    PositionLiquidity[] mints;
    SwapPayload swap;
   .....
}

and then it tries to rebalance based on user given burn amount.
if the input burn value is max of uint256, it updates the logic to use the pool's liquidity value. Refer the part of codes from rebalance function.

                if (rebalanceParams_.burns[i].liquidity == type(uint128).max)
                    liquidityToWithdraw = liquidity; ------------------------------------>> uses the pool's liquidity
                else liquidityToWithdraw = rebalanceParams_.burns[i].liquidity;  ----->> uses the user input


But, if the `rebalanceParams_.burns[i].liquidity > liquidity` it is not updating the `liquidityToWithdraw`  variable and tries to use the user given burn amount and proceed further. This would revert from uniswap side while try to burn more than available liquidity.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lets look at the rebalance function.

    function rebalance(Rebalance calldata rebalanceParams_)
        external
        onlyManager
        nonReentrant
    {
        // Burns.
        IUniswapV3Factory mFactory = factory;
        IERC20 mToken0 = token0;
        IERC20 mToken1 = token1;


        {
            Withdraw memory aggregator;
            for (uint256 i; i < rebalanceParams_.burns.length; i++) {
                IUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(
                    mFactory.getPool(
                        address(mToken0),
                        address(mToken1),
                        rebalanceParams_.burns[i].range.feeTier
                    )
                );


                uint128 liquidity = Position.getLiquidityByRange(
                    pool,
                    address(this),
                    rebalanceParams_.burns[i].range.lowerTick,
                    rebalanceParams_.burns[i].range.upperTick
                );


                if (liquidity == 0) continue;


                uint128 liquidityToWithdraw;


                if (rebalanceParams_.burns[i].liquidity == type(uint128).max)
                    liquidityToWithdraw = liquidity;
                else liquidityToWithdraw = rebalanceParams_.burns[i].liquidity;
               
                 -------------------------------------->>> no check to validate the  rebalanceParams_.burns[i].liquidity > liquidity 


                Withdraw memory withdraw = _withdraw(
                    pool,
                    rebalanceParams_.burns[i].range.lowerTick,
                    rebalanceParams_.burns[i].range.upperTick,
                    liquidityToWithdraw
                );

[ArrakisV2.sol#L276-L278](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L276-L278) has the logic to check and update the liquidity value that is going to be used down the road.

when it updates for max of uint256 case, but it misses for the cause which this report is pointing.

## Impact

1. Rebalance would revert due to insufficient liquidity in from pool.
2. though the function has `onlyManager` protection and input parameter can be modified after the function failures. But still it would be a cause of concern. 
3. Missing of timely rebalance would lead to unexpected consequences like loss of funds and other issues.

## Recommendation

Update the logic [here ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L276C39-L278) such that if the `rebalanceParams_.burns[i].liquidity > liquidity(pool's liquidity)` use the pool's liquidity for further process.
