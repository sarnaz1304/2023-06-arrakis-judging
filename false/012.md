# Potential Inadequate Checks Before Minting Liquidity

## Summary

The mint() function in the ArrakisV2.sol contract does not sufficiently validate all inputs and scenarios before minting new liquidity tokens, which may be a potential vulnerability for abuse.

## Vulnerability Detail

The mint() function checks whether the mint amount is greater than zero and whether the sender is either the `restrictedMint` or the `restrictedMint` is not defined. If these conditions are met, it calculates the amount of underlying assets to deposit in the pool and mints liquidity tokens. However, there are some issues to address.

Firstly, it does not check whether the receiver address is a valid non-zero address. Therefore, it's possible for an attacker to burn tokens from the sender's address and the tokens would be minted to a zero address, causing a potential loss of funds.

Secondly, if the total supply is zero, it calculates the deposit amounts based on the `init0` and `init1` parameters. However, it does not validate whether these parameters are zero, which may result in a division by zero error.

## Impact

The contract allows to mint tokens to a zero address, which could cause a loss of funds for the token holders. Also, if the `init0` or `init1` parameters are zero, it may result in a division by zero error, potentially disrupting the execution of the contract.

## Code Snippet

The code snippet of concern is within the mint() function of the ArrakisV2.sol contract:

```solidity
function mint(uint256 mintAmount_, address receiver_)
    external
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
{
    require(mintAmount_ > 0, "MA");
    require(
        restrictedMint == address(0) || msg.sender == restrictedMint,
        "R"
    );
    // ... rest of function ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend adding validation to ensure that the receiver address is a valid non-zero address. Additionally, the `init0` and `init1` parameters should also be validated to prevent a division by zero error.

## Proof Of Concept

To reproduce this issue:

1. Call the mint function with a zero address as the receiver. The function will execute successfully and tokens will be minted to the zero address.
2. Set the `init0` or `init1` parameters to zero and call the mint function when the total supply is zero. This will result in a division by zero error.
