# Comparison Operator Inaccuracy

## Summary
The issue in the burn function involves the comparison operators used to check the values of underlying.leftOver0 and underlying.leftOver1 against amount0 and amount1, respectively. The operators used are >=, which means that if underlying.leftOver0 or underlying.leftOver1 is equal to amount0 or amount1, the condition will be true.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/ArrakisFinance/v2-core/blob/376bfcec803f0644fdc601db3a5772d2179c13a0/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L146
 underlying.leftOver0 >= amount0 && underlying.leftOver1 >= amount1 @audit
Comparison of underlying.leftOver0 and underlying.leftOver1 with amount0 and amount1 using >= operator
example:
lets say that the remaining balance of a token, underlying.leftOver0, is 5. Now, let's say we want to transfer an amount of 5 tokens, specified by amount0.
The problem arises with the condition used for comparison: (underlying.leftOver0 >= amount0). In this case, 5 is indeed greater than or equal to 5, so the condition evaluates to true.


## Impact
This can potentially result in transferring more tokens than necessary. The issue lies in the possibility of overtransferring tokens due to the imprecise comparison operators used.

## Recommendation
use  (>) instead of greater-than-or-equal-to (>=)
