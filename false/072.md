# Implementation of OZ's ownable now requires a direct call to set the owner



## Summary

The Arrakis protocol employs several contracts that inherit from OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract. A recent modification in the OpenZeppelin library now requires explicit definition of the contract owner during deployment, which deviates from the previous practice of automatically setting the owner as the contract's deployer.

## Vulnerability Detail

The OpenZeppelin library's `Ownable.sol` has recently undergone a significant change. Earlier, the contract owner was automatically designated as the account that deployed the contract. However, the new update requires the contract owner to be specified explicitly as a constructor argument during deployment. An idea of the details of this modification can be found on this back & forth discussion with OZ, found [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/4368).

## Impact

Owner of contracts defaultly gets set to the 0x0 address

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the ownable.sol implementations to include the explicit call to the `Ownable` constructor.
