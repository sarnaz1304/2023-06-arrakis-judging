# Ownable is used, but owner not initialized

## Summary
We can see that [ChainLinkOraclePivot](https://github.com/ArrakisFinance/v2-manager-templates/blob/9b598356f9fb31e4fbaf07acf060e1f60409a7b0/contracts/oracles/ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol#L11) is using  Open-zeppelin `Ownable`, but it is [not initializing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-manager-templates/contracts/oracles/ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol#L43-L62) it.
## Vulnerability Detail
`Ownable` now requires the contract to specifically give it's address to initialize the owner.
[Ownable.sol/L38-L40](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol#L38-L40)
```jsx
    constructor(address initialOwner) {
        _transferOwnership(initialOwner);
    }
```
Thus if the owner is not initialized it may lead to contract not being able to operate in fully. Example is `setOutdated()` function, as it's has a modifier `onlyOwner()`. 
```jsx
    function setOutdated(uint256 outdated_) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 oldOutdated = outdated;
        outdated = outdated_;
        emit LogSetOutdated(address(this), oldOutdated, outdated_);
    }
```
## Impact
`Ownable` is not initialized it could lead to contract malfunctioning, or some parameters being hard-coded.
