# XO-`whitelist` function does not properly check if an address is in the `_mintWhitelist` set before adding it to the set.

## Summary
- The require statement in the `whitelist` function vulnerable can allow attacker to mint tokens from the vault even though they are not supposed to be able to.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function whitelist(address vault_, address[] memory toWhitelist_)
        external
        onlyOwner
    {
        require(mintRestrictedVaults[vault_].supplyCap > 0, "vault not set");
        for (uint256 i; i < toWhitelist_.length; i++) {
            require(_mintWhitelist[vault_].add(toWhitelist_[i]), "add failed");
        }

        emit LogWhitelist(vault_, toWhitelist_);
    }

```
- The `_mintWhitelist` set is only updated after the require statement has executed. This means that it is possible for the require statement to pass even though the `_mintWhitelist` set does not actually contain the address `toWhitelist_[i]` especially The require statement is checking to make sure that the `_mintWhitelist` set contains the address `toWhitelist_[i]` 
## Impact
- the `_mintWhitelist` set that is not actually allowed to mint tokens. it's allow  to mint tokens from the vault even though they are not supposed to be able to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  the require statement should be moved after the `_mintWhitelist` set has been updated. This will ensure that the require statement only passes if the `_mintWhitelist` set actually contains the address `toWhitelist_[i].`
