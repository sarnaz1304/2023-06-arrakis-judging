# Missing vault authenticity check opens possibilities for attacks targeted as stealing user funds

## Summary
When interacting with Arrakis vaults via `ArrakisV2Router`, the vault address parameter is not validated for authenticity. A malicious actor can trick users into adding liquidity into a malicious vault that steals user funds. In this scenario, the attack will be conducted via the official `ArrakisV2Router` router, which will additionally harm the reputation of the project.
## Vulnerability Detail
[ArrakisV2Router](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L33) is a higher-level contract that allows users to interact with Arrakis vaults. Functions [addLiquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L50), [addLiquidityPermit2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L238), [swapAndAddLiquidity](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L129), and [swapAndAddLiquidityPermit2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L309) take an Arrakis vault address and transfer user funds to the address. However, they don't check that the contract at the provided address is the authentic Arrakis vault (`ArrakisV2`).

A malicious actor can trick users into calling either of the above functions on the official `ArrakisV2Router` with a malicious vault address passed in the function's arguments. Since users must approve spending of tokens to the router ([so it could take them](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L94-L99)), and the router then [approves tokens to the passed vault address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L409-L410), users will be confident that they're interacting with the original protocol's contract (`ArrakisV2Router`) while, in fact, their funds will be transferred to a malicious vault.
## Impact
Users can lose funds while interacting with the official `ArrakisV2Router` contract. A malicious actor can run an attack on the users of Arrakis to trick them into adding liquidity into a malicious vault contract. The funds will be stolen, and the protocol will bear a significant reputational damage.


A similar attack vector was [recently exploited in Sushiswap](https://blog.solidityscan.com/sushiswap-hack-analysis-improper-router-approve-parameters-68bfd266c33b), which lead to a loss of over $3.3M.
## Code Snippet
1. `params_.vault` is not checked for authenticity in `addLiquidity` and all the other functions that add liquidity into a vault:
[ArrakisV2Router.sol#L61-L84](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L61-L84)
1. The router trusts the passed vault address, approves user funds' to it, and calls `mint`:
[ArrakisV2Router.sol#L409-L410](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L409-L410)
[ArrakisV2Router.sol#L432-L434](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L432-L434)
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider adding validation of the vault address argument in `ArrakisV2Router.addLiquidity`, `ArrakisV2Router.addLiquidityPermit2`, `ArrakisV2Router.swapAndAddLiquidity`, and `ArrakisV2Router.swapAndAddLiquidityPermit2`. The check needs to ensure that the passed address is an `ArrakisV2` contract that was deployed via `ArrakisV2Factory`. For this, `ArrakisV2Factory` needs to allow to query a vault by its address. I.e. consider adding a function to `ArrakisV2Factory` that returns true when a passed address was earlier deployed by the factory contract, or returns false otherwise.
