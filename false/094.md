# ArrakisV2Storage.setManager doesn't collect all manager's fees

## Summary
ArrakisV2Storage.setManager doesn't collect all manager's fees
## Vulnerability Detail
Manager earns fees, that are accumulated into `managerBalance0` and `managerBalance1` variables. These fees are collected, only when [withdraw is done](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L433-L439) from uniswap, because withdraw calls `collect`.

Manager of vault [can be changed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L209-L213). This will [send all accumulated fees to the current manager](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L273-L289).

The problem is that not all fees are collected for the manager and as result he losses some of them. In order to pay all his fees, then `burn` with 0 liquidity should be done for all ranges and then `collect` should be called and fees should be accrued.
## Impact
Previous manager doesn't receive all earned fees.

## Recommendation
Collect fees for all existing ranges and accrued them to current manager, before the change.
