# Risk in rebalance() due to existence of Multiple UniswapV3 Pools for same pairs

## Summary

The `rebalance` function in Arrakis Finance's protocol plays a critical role in adjusting vaults. However, the potential for exploitation exists, particularly by operators who might manipulate prices and cause losses to the lending pool. This scenario becomes increasingly plausible with Uniswap V3 pools that possess low Total Value Locked (TVL). It is important to note that operators are semi-trusted as per the information in the [readMe](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis#q-are-there-any-additional-protocol-roles-if-yes-please-explain-in-detail)... quoting the readme:
_Operators are "semi trusted" ..._

## Vulnerability Detail

Uniswap V3 supports multiple pools for identical pairs of ERC20 tokens, albeit with varying fee parameters. While some pools amass substantial liquidity, others might have minimal TVL or may not have been created at all. Bad actors, acting as operators, can potentially exploit this feature by creating a low TVL pool with liquidity primarily (or entirely) favoring their position. When the `rebalance` function gets called in a transaction involving such low liquidity pools, the price can be manipulated within a single block, thereby causing losses to the Arrakis V2 pool.

The potential attack can be seen in the `rebalance` function as follows:

```solidity
function rebalance(
    address vault_,
    Rebalance calldata rebalanceParams_
) external {
    require(_operators.contains(msg.sender), "NO");
    require(
        IArrakisV2(vault_).manager() == address(this) &&
            address(vaults[vault_].oracle) != address(0),
        "NM"
    );
    // omitted for brevity
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Audit

## Recommendation

Implementing a whitelist of approved pools with a reliable TVL could help secure the system.
