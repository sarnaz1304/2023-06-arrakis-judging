# Re-entrancy Attack on `SimpleManager.sol`

## Summary

`SimpleManager.sol` contract could be vulnerable to a re-entrancy attack, particularly in the `withdrawAndCollectFees` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `withdrawAndCollectFees` function, external calls are made first (`vaults_[i].withdrawManagerBalance()`), and then the contract state is updated (`IERC20(tokens_[i]).safeTransfer(target, balance)`). This sequence could open up the contract for potential re-entrancy attacks. 

## Impact

An attacker may be able to trigger a function in the contract again, before the first function call is finished. This could allow the attacker to potentially "withdraw" more funds than they should be able to.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function withdrawAndCollectFees(
    IArrakisV2[] calldata vaults_,
    IERC20[] calldata tokens_,
    address target
) external onlyOwner requireAddressNotZero(target) {
    uint256 vaultsLength = vaults_.length;

    for (uint256 i; i < vaultsLength; ++i) {
        require(
            vaults_[i].manager() == address(this) &&
                address(vaults[address(vaults_[i])].oracle) != address(0),
            "NM"
        );

        vaults_[i].withdrawManagerBalance();
    }

    uint256 tokensLength = tokens_.length;
    for (uint256 i; i < tokensLength; ++i) {
        uint256 balance = IERC20(tokens_[i]).balanceOf(address(this));
        if (balance > 0) IERC20(tokens_[i]).safeTransfer(target, balance);
    }

}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a mutex or a re-entrancy guard to protect against re-entrancy attacks. You can use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` contract to achieve this.

## Proof Of Concept

To reproduce this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be in control of a contract that is able to call `withdrawAndCollectFees`. In the `withdrawManagerBalance` function call, the attacker's contract would then call `withdrawAndCollectFees` again before the first call is finished.
