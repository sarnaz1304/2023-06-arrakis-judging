# Incomplete access control for supply capacity

## Summary
In `v2-periphery` -> `ArrakisV2RouterStorage.sol`, logic around supply capacity is incomplete.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Once supply capacity is set through `setMintRules`, it can't be set back to zero, which means there will always be limited capacity for minting LP. There is a possibility to set it to `uint256.max`, but it will leads to unnecessary external calls and checking for every minting which I don't think logically valid.

2. For setting whitelist and blacklist addresses, it's checked if supply capacity is positive which doesn't make sense. Whitelisting feature is an independent from having positive supply capacity. If it's insisted that whitelisting is only applied when supply capacity is positive, checking whitelist address `_addLiquidity` function is invalid.(whitelist checking needs go inside if statement that checks supply capacity)

## Impact
This is an issue related to access control logic, doesn't cause loss of funds but it will lead to inappropriate admin control for router management.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Set an ability to set supply capacity back to zero.
2. Remove supply capacity checking in `whitelist` and `blacklist` functions.
3. (Not related to this issue but suggested anyway) No need to check if address is exactly added/removed from `_mintWhitelist`.
