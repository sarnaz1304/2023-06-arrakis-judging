# swapAndAddLiquidityPermit2 can be altered with reentracy before completing its execution

## Summary
(_permit2SwapAndAdd and _swapAndAddLiquidity) occur before updating the state variables or completing other critical operations. This can allow an attacker to recursively call the swapAndAddLiquidityPermit2 function during the execution of these token transfers, leading to reentrancy attacks. 
## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker calls the swapAndAddLiquidityPermit2 function.
The attacker prepares a malicious contract with a fallback function that calls the swapAndAddLiquidityPermit2 function again.
During the token transfer step, the attacker's fallback function is triggered.
The fallback function calls the swapAndAddLiquidityPermit2 function again before the previous execution completes.
The process repeats, resulting in a reentrant attack where the attacker can drain the contract's funds or manipulate its state variables. 
## Impact
An attacker can create a malicious contract then recursively call the swapAndAddLiquidityPermit2 function before the state is updated, allowing them to manipulate the state and drain funds from the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern. In this case, the token transfers and critical operations should be performed after updating the state variables
