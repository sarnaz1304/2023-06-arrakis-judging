# Transfered Ether will be lost if the amount sent is insufficient for the intended swap or liquidity addition

## Summary
There are no validations to ensure that the amount of ETH sent by the caller matches the expected amount for the token swap. The function assumes that the caller has sent the correct amount of ETH and proceeds with the token transfers and liquidity addition without performing any additional checks
## Vulnerability Detail
If the _wrapETH function does not handle the Ether transfer correctly or if it fails to revert in case of an error. If the transfer fails or if the _wrapETH function has any unintended behavior, it will result in Ether being locked in the contract without any way to recover it.
## Impact
A caller who provides an incorrect amount of ETH will lead to imbalanced token swaps, resulting in unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.
