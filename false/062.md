# external re-entrant-able `_unwrapRefundETH` is called before tokenTransfer during _swapAndAddLiquidity on ArrakisRouter

## Summary
external re-entrant-able `_unwrapRefundETH` is called before tokenTransfer during _swapAndAddLiquidity on ArrakisRouter

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_swapAndAddLiquidity`, it called `_unwrapRefundETH` and send any excess ETH to the msg.sender back through `sendValue` from the Address library of Openzeppelin.
 
However, the external call is done BEFORE the excess ERC20 token is transferred back. This creates room for re-entrancy before all effect of the function is completed. this is advisably should be avoided and also we can see other part of the code tried to do so.

```solidity
        if (msg.value > 0) {
            isToken0Weth = _isToken0Weth(address(token0_), address(token1_));
            if (isToken0Weth && amount0Use > amount0) {
                _unwrapRefundETH(msg.sender, amount0Use - amount0);
            } else if (!isToken0Weth && amount1Use > amount1) {
                _unwrapRefundETH(msg.sender, amount1Use - amount1);
            }
        }

        if (amount0Use > amount0 && (msg.value == 0 || !isToken0Weth)) {
            token0_.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount0Use - amount0);
        }
        if (amount1Use > amount1 && (msg.value == 0 || isToken0Weth)) {
            token1_.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount1Use - amount1);
        }
```
_unwrapRefundETH calls sendValue from Openzeppelin 
```solidity
    function _unwrapRefundETH(address refund_, uint256 refundAmount_) internal {
        weth.withdraw(refundAmount_);
        payable(refund_).sendValue(refundAmount_);
    }

     * IMPORTANT: because control is transferred to `recipient`, care must be
     * taken to not create reentrancy vulnerabilities. Consider using
     * {ReentrancyGuard} or the
     * https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.8.0/security-considerations.html#use-the-checks-effects-interactions-pattern[checks-effects-interactions pattern].
     */
    function sendValue(address payable recipient, uint256 amount) internal {
        if (address(this).balance < amount) {
            revert AddressInsufficientBalance(address(this));
        }

        (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert FailedInnerCall();
        }
    }

## Impact
re-entrancy of function is possible even before all effect of the function is executed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
change the order of `_unwrapRefundETH` such that it is executed AFTER the ERC20 token transfer.
