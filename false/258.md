# More checks needed for Chainlink price feed

## Summary
Not enough checks have been implemented on the return values that Chainlink's `latestRoundData` function returns.

## Vulnerability Detail
As the summary above states, not checking these values could result in stale/incorrect prices. For example, suppose there is a problem with Chainlink starting a new [round](https://solodit.xyz/issues/5699) and finding consensus on the new value for the oracle. In that case, consumers of this contract may continue using outdated stale data. Another issue that can arise due to insufficient checks on the price of the asset - [https://solodit.xyz/issues/6663](https://solodit.xyz/issues/6663)

## Impact
Stale/Incorrect data will be used for the tokens.

## Code Snippet
The [getPrice0](https://github.com/ArrakisFinance/v2-manager-templates/blob/9b598356f9fb31e4fbaf07acf060e1f60409a7b0/contracts/oracles/ChainLinkOracle.sol#L68) and [getPrice1](https://github.com/ArrakisFinance/v2-manager-templates/blob/9b598356f9fb31e4fbaf07acf060e1f60409a7b0/contracts/oracles/ChainLinkOracle.sol#L109) functions in the ChainlinkOracle.sol contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that the following checks be added: 

```solidity
require(price > 0, "Negative Oracle Price");
require(block.timestamp - updatedAt <= outdated , "ChainLinkOracle: outdated.");
require(price < maxPrice, "Upper price bound breached");
require(price > minPrice, "Lower price bound breached");
require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "round not complete");
```
