# Restricted minter check can be bypassed

## Summary
Anyone can mint liquidity in an Arrakis pool before the [restrictedMint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L228) flag is set, thus restricting minter can be bypassed. In some scenarios, a call to [setRestrictedMint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L227) can be front-run to add liquidity to a pool that will become restricted after the call.
## Vulnerability Detail
In [ArrakisV2Storage.initialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L118), the `restrictedMint` variable cannot be set, thus a vault cannot be made restricted during its initialization. The vault's owner will have to make a separate call to [setRestrictedMint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L227) to set the address of the minter who's allowed to add liquidity. However, before the call is made, anyone can mint liquidity in the pool, even if the pool is supposed to have a restricted minter.
## Impact
Restricting minting to a specific address can be bypassed, allowing anyone to add liquidity in pools that are supposed to receive liquidity only from the minter address.
## Code Snippet
1. In [ArrakisV2Storage.initialize](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L118), there's no way to set the `restrictedMint` variable.
1. The variable can only be set in a separate call to [setRestrictMint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L228).
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
In `ArrakisV2Storage.initialize()`, consider letting the caller set a restricted minter address: `InitializePayload` can have a `restrictedMint` field, which is set to the `restrictedMint` storage variable during vault initialization.
