# Owner can withdraw funds from contracts that are not intended to be managed by the SimpleManager

## Summary
In the withdrawAndCollectFees function, , there is no check to ensure that the vaults being processed are actually instances of the IArrakisV2 contract managed by the SimpleManager contract
## Vulnerability Detail
The withdrawAndCollectFees function does not validate that the vault contract is an instance of the IArrakisV2 contract before allowing the owner to withdraw funds. This means that if a contract that is not an IArrakisV2 contract is passed as a parameter to this function, the owner would still be able to withdraw funds from it. 
## Impact
Owner can withdraw funds from contracts that are not managed by the SimpleManager, those funds will be permanently lost or inaccessible. The SimpleManager contract is specifically designed to manage certain contracts, and withdrawing funds from other contracts will lead to the loss of those funds.
