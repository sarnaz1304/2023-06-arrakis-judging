# Data received from chainlink is not successfully checked to be within the valid boundaries


## Summary

The `ChainLinkOraclePivot` and `ChainlinkOracle` contracts do good jobs in making sure the data gotten from the chainlink oracle are correct or the call reverts, this cocnclusion is reached since the check for outdated price and sequencer are implemented, the `ChainlinkOracle` contract even employs safecast to protect against negative prices when executing the `latestRoundDat`a function. Nevertheless, it does not incorporate a mechanism to verify that the returned prices do not hit the extreme boundaries `(minAnswer and maxAnswer)`. The absence of this mechanism may cause the contract to operate based on incorrect prices, potentially leading to an over- or under-estimation of the asset's value, which could significantly affect the protocol's financial stability.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Chainlink aggregators feature an integrated circuit breaker that is triggered when an asset's price falls outside of a predefined price band. In an event where an asset's value experiences a substantial drop (akin to the LUNA crash), the oracle price will persist in returning the minPrice, instead of the actual market price of the asset. This allows users to continue borrowing against the asset at an incorrect price, analogous to what occurred with [Venus on BSC during the LUNA collapse](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).

In its existing form, the [ `_getLatestRoundData`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/9594cf930307ebbfe5cae4f8ad9e9b40b26c9fec/v2-manager-templates/contracts/oracles/ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol#L229-L275) function within the ChainLinkOraclePivot contract obtains the latest round data from the Chainlink Feed. If the asset's market price falls below minAnswer or exceeds maxAnswer, the returned price will still be the minAnswer or maxAnswer, respectively, rather than the actual market price. This can lead to a situation where the protocol transacts with the asset using incorrect pricing data, thereby potentially enabling exploitative behavior.

## Impact

The risk is apparent when the actual price of an asset changes drastically, but the oracle continues to function using the minAnswer or maxAnswer as the asset's price. This situation would obviously allow manipulative actions.

## Code Snippet

[ `_getLatestRoundData`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/9594cf930307ebbfe5cae4f8ad9e9b40b26c9fec/v2-manager-templates/contracts/oracles/ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol#L229-L275)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The [ `_getLatestRoundData`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/9594cf930307ebbfe5cae4f8ad9e9b40b26c9fec/v2-manager-templates/contracts/oracles/ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol#L229-L275) function should be adjusted to include a validation check. If the returned price equals minAnswer or maxAnswer, the function should revert to avoid operating on potentially incorrect prices. This could be implemented in a similar way to this:

```diff
// @audit-fix M implement check for minAnswer/maxAnswer case
function _getLatestRoundData()
    internal
    view
    returns (
        uint256 priceA,
        uint256 priceB,
        uint8 priceFeedADecimals,
        uint8 priceFeedBDecimals
    )
{
    try priceFeedA.latestRoundData() returns (
        uint80,
        int256 price,
        uint256,
        uint256 updatedAt,
        uint80
    ) {
        require(
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= outdated, // solhint-disable-line not-rely-on-time
            "ChainLinkOracle: priceFeedA outdated."
        );
+        require(price > minAnswer && price < maxAnswer, "price outside valid range");

        priceA = SafeCast.toUint256(price);
    } catch {
        revert("ChainLinkOracle: price feed A call failed.");
    }
    ...
}
```
