# Oracle will return the wrong price for asset if underlying aggregator hits `minAnswer`

## Summary
In `ChainLinkOracle.sol` and `ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol`, `getPrice0()` and `getPrice1()` will return the wrong price for the asset if the underlying aggregator hits `minAnswer `

## Vulnerability Detail

Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash) the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. This would allow user to continue borrowing with the asset but at the wrong price. This is exactly what happened to [Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).

When `latestRoundData()` is called it requests data from the aggregator. The aggregator has a minPrice and a maxPrice. If the price falls below the minPrice instead of reverting it will just return the min price.

## Impact

In the event that an asset crashes the protocol can be manipulated to give out loans at an inflated price

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`getPrice0()` and `getPrice1()` should check the returned answer against the minPrice/maxPrice and revert if the answer is outside of the bounds:

```solidity
if (price >= maxPrice or price <= minPrice) revert();
```
