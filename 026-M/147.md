# Chainlink might hit min-answer resulting in incorrect price passes

## Summary
Chainlink price might hit a pre-set min-answer for a token, when this happens incorrect token price will pass to the protocol based on the current implementation.
## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink oracle has pre-set min-answer and max-answer for a given asset. When this boundary is surpassed, chainlink will continue to report the min-answer or max-answer. It's dangerous for a protocol to not account for such a scenario. An example is LUNA crash. During the incident, chainlink continuously reports the min-answer which is much higher than actual market price.

In ChainlinkOracle.sol `getPrice0()`, the returned price freshness is checked but there is no verification on min-answer. 

```solidity
//ChaininkOracle.sol
    function getPrice0() external view override returns (uint256 price0) {
        if (address(sequencerUptimeFeed) != address(0)) _checkSequencer();

        try priceFeed.latestRoundData() returns (
            uint80,
            int256 price,
            uint256,
            uint256 updatedAt,
            uint80
        ) {
            require(
                block.timestamp - updatedAt <= outdated, // solhint-disable-line not-rely-on-time
                "ChainLinkOracle: outdated."
            );
...
``` 
This price is passed to SimpleManager.sol to check uniswap pool price deviation in `rebalance()`. When there is too much deviation, the manager determines the uniswap pool has a distorted price and revert the transaction.

```solidity
//SimpleManager.sol-rebalance()
...
            _checkDeviation(
                poolPrice,
                oraclePrice,
                vaultInfo.maxDeviation,
                token1Decimals
            );
...
```
```solidity
//SimpleManager.sol-_checkDeviation()
...
        uint256 deviation = FullMath.mulDiv(
            ////note: this scale the ratio up to priceDecimals,
            ////note: then scaled down the ratio to 4 decimals (100 hundre percent =10000)
            FullMath.mulDiv(
                currentPrice_ > oraclePrice_
                    ? currentPrice_ - oraclePrice_
                    : oraclePrice_ - currentPrice_,
                10 ** priceDecimals_,
                oraclePrice_
            ),
            hundred_percent,
            10 ** priceDecimals_
        );
        require(deviation <= maxDeviation_, "maxDeviation");
...
```
## Impact
When chainlink min-answer is reported, the market price is likely much lower than the reported price. In this case, uniswap pool price will be unfairly determined to be distorted causing `rebalance()` to revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
(1)Implement a second oracle in ChainlinkOracle.sol to check deviation before passing chainlink answer to SimpleManager.sol
(2)Or in `_checkDeviation`, add a check for deviation between twap price and spot price.
