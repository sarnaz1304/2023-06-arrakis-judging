# All vaults will become incompatible with uniswap V3 if governance votes on adding a protocolFee

## Summary
The uniswap V3 team has polled adding a protocol fee to trades in order to increase profits for governance. The consequence is that liquidity providers will forfeit a percentage of their fees which will be distributed to governance holders. The current Arrakis vault calculations do not take the protocol fee into account and will end up with incorrect values for LP fees if the protocol fee is non-zero. 

While it's not yet certain on whether the frequent proposals will pass or not, there is a definite push for them which will only become more likely with time and as uniswap V4 and later versions are released.
## Impact
Vault calculations will become incorrect and the vault will transfer an incorrect amount of tokens when users burn their shares.
