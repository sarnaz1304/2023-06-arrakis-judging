# ChainLinkOraclePivot uses the same outdated timestamp for all feeds

## Summary
ChainLinkOraclePivot uses the same timestamp (`uint outdated`) to check if priceFeedA and priceFeedB data are not stale. But this is bad because different feeds have different heartbeats--which is the time the data is updated.

## Vulnerability Detail
For example, on optimism chain, [ETH feed](https://data.chain.link/optimism/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd) has a heartbeat of just 20 minutes while [LUSD feed](https://data.chain.link/optimism/mainnet/crypto-usd/lusd-usd) has a heartbeat of 24 hours (or 1440 minutes). If we have such a pair and using ChainLinkOraclePivot, then `outdated` would need to be set to a value that's at least 1440 minutes so that LUSD won't always revert but that would give ETH price feed the tolerance to be stale for **72 rounds**.

## Impact
We have to choose between DoS or tolerating stale prices. If stale price is tolerated, this would have consequences when checking deviation and minimum output in SimpleManager.

## Recommendation
use different timestamps to check if priceFeedA and priceFeedB are outdated.
