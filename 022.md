# No checks if liquidity to mint is zero in ArrakisV2.mint()

## Summary
Liquidity to mint can be zero and there is no check against that in ArrakisV2.mint(). 

This was one of the findings in one of the previous Audits -- https://gist.github.com/kassandraoftroy/b820573c16972e158715678004ae2dff#1-no-checks-if-liquidity-to-mint-is-zero, but it was not fixed
## Vulnerability Detail
In the function [ArrakisV2.mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L143), if the mintAmount_ is small then liquidity can round down to 0. In that case, the transaction reverts in pool.mint().
## Impact
 if the `mintAmount_` is small then liquidity can round down to 0. That will make the transaction revert in pool.mint()

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 It is recommended to move the check at the line [ArrakisV2.sol#L143](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L143) to line 148.
