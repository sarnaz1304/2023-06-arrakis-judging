# ArrakisV2Router doesn't have timestamp protection

## Summary

ArrakisV2Router doesn't have timestamp protection. For comparison, uniswap routers are [protected](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/6cce88e63e176af1ddb6cc56e029110289622317/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L202).

## Vulnerability Detail

The tx may remain in the mempool for a long time, and if the price changes drastically during this period, the user may lose money even if the slippage protection range entered by the user is met.    
Functions such as `swapAndAddLiquidity` that interact with uniswap don't need to add timestamp protection in Arrakis, but other functions need.  

## Impact

If token prices change dramatically, user funds may be lost.
