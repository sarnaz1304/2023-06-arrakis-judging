# Fees are not distributed pro rata creating a race condition

## Summary
Anyone can mint a large portion of pool tokens in relation to the `totalSupply` and steal all fees. This is due to the fact that fees are not checkpointed and instead are claimed upon burning at the current state of share supply.

## Vulnerability Detail
**An easy example:** 
- `totalSupply` = 1000
- $50 worth of USDC pending fees in UniV3
- $50 worth of WETH pending fees in UniV3
- User mints **9000 shares**.
- User claims 90% of all pending fees by burning position.

Each update to the `totalSupply` needs to checkpoint the fees that should be attributed to each user. As of now, there is a race condition to claim all fees. With enough capital, a whale can claim almost 100% of the fees simply by minting more shares than the total supply and immediately burning.

Claiming fees occurs via the `burn()` function. The pending fees are sent to the `ArrakisV2` contract, and an amount of fees are transferred to the user based on the amount of shares burned in relation to the total supply.

```solidity
        uint256 leftOver0 = token0.balanceOf(address(this)) -
            managerBalance0 -
            total.burn0;
        uint256 leftOver1 = token1.balanceOf(address(this)) -
            managerBalance1 -
            total.burn1;


        // the proportion of user balance.
        amount0 = FullMath.mulDiv(leftOver0, burnAmount_, ts);
        amount1 = FullMath.mulDiv(leftOver1, burnAmount_, ts);
```

Since there is no checkpoint system in place, a user can mint a large quantity of tokens and burn them all to claim all the fees.

## Impact
- Theft of pending fees

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a checkpoint system to ensure that all changes to the token supply are accounted for so that fees can be distributed pro rata based on the previous share distribution.
