# Donation Attack to ArrakisV2

## Summary

A malicious user can directly transfer underlying tokens to arrakisV2 contract, this will increase the amount of underlying required for minting shares, and imbalance the underlying to share ratio.

## Vulnerability Detail

The mint() function of ArrakisV2 calls Underlying.totalUnderlyingForMint();
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L68

The totalUnderlyingForMint() calculates the amount needed for the desired mint based on the token balance of ArrakisV2 contract.

```solidity

amount0 += FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
            mintAmount_,
            fee0After +
                IERC20(underlyingPayload_.token0).balanceOf(
                    underlyingPayload_.self
                ) -
                arrakisV2.managerBalance0(),
            totalSupply_
        );

```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol#L72-L89

After this, the desired amount of shares is minted, and the corresponding amount of tokens transferred from the sender to the contract.

```solidity

_mint(receiver_, mintAmount_);

        // transfer amounts owed to contract
        if (amount0 > 0) {
            token0.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, me, amount0);
        }
        if (amount1 > 0) {
            token1.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, me, amount1);
        }
        
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L117-L125

This can be exploited by first using the mint() function to mint some amount of shares. After this the user transfers some amount of underlying token to the contract, which will increase the share price. 

Every user that try's to mint shares after this, will pay an inflated share price.

## Impact

If any malicious user transfers underlying tokens directly to the contract, there wont be any shares minted and all users after will pay an inflated price for the shares.

The attacker doesn't experience any financial loss, because the burn function uses the balance, which means he can withdraw his donated underlying with previous minted shares.

Inflating the share price can lead to severe problems with other protocols or DEX, which assume the amount of underlying and total supply of shares are proportional to each other.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not use balanceOf() to get the amount of underlying. Save underlying as an storage variable and use that to determine the amount deposited.
