# Oracle manipulation in Optimism network

## Summary

The Protocol is intended to be deployed on the Optimism network. Currently, it utilizes the TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price) oracle, which has a vulnerability. In Optimism, the oracle price can be easily manipulated due to the high-latency block.timestamp update process. This makes the oracle susceptible to manipulation, rendering Uniswap pools on Optimism unsuitable for providing accurate oracle prices.

## Impact

The vulnerability allows for price manipulation, resulting in swap transactions being executed at incorrect prices.

## Code Snippet

You can find the code snippet demonstrating the vulnerability at the following link:
[GitHub - TWAP.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/9594cf930307ebbfe5cae4f8ad9e9b40b26c9fec/v2-manager-templates/contracts/libraries/Twap.sol#L22)

## Tool used

The vulnerability was identified through a manual review.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is advised not to use TWAP in Optimism. Instead, consider utilizing the Chainlink oracle, which provides more reliable and secure oracle price data.
