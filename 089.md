# Lack of Required Checks Allows Unauthorized Minting in mint() Function

## Summary

The `mint()` function in the contract allows anyone to mint shares for free if they call the function when there is no range set. This allows an attacker to accumulate shares without providing any liquidity, and later exploit these shares to withdraw funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

During ArrakisV2Vault deployment nothing is made on `ArrakisV2Storage.sol#initialize()` to fill `Range[] internal _ranges;` variable. 
A good point is that on the ArrakisV2.sol#mint() function first user to mint will be a trusted user expected to mint  to 0x0000000000000â€¦.dead address.
Then the process for minting shares when totalSupply of lpShares is > 0 is like this : 

1. call ArrakisV2.sol#mint()
2. (amount0, amount1) = UnderlyingHelper.totalUnderlyingForMint()
3. _mint(receiver_, mintAmount_);
4. amount0,amount1 are transferred from msg.sender to ArrakisV2.sol
5. UniV3 mint 

The problem happens when a malicious user call mint() function before `_ranges` is filled, as there is no check whether _ranges contains values and regarding the fact that `amount0` and `amount1` will depend on this "for" loop : `for (uint256 i; i < underlyingPayload_.ranges.length; i++)` . But as ranges are not filled, the loop won't be executed and malicious user will just have to pay a very few amount for minting shares , process in this case is like this : 

1. Malicious user call ArrakisV2.sol#mint(), totalSupply is greater than zero so we have to calculate amount0,amount1 to be deposited
2. (amount0, amount1) = UnderlyingHelper.totalUnderlyingForMint() : 
```solidity
    function totalUnderlyingForMint(underlyingPayload_,mintAmount_,totalSupply_) 
        public view returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
        uint256 fee0;
        uint256 fee1;
        for (uint256 i; i < underlyingPayload_.ranges.length; i++) {
            {
                ... // Not executed if no ranges
            }
        }

        IArrakisV2 arrakisV2 = IArrakisV2(underlyingPayload_.self);
       //E  feeX = feeX_ - ((feeX_ * (managerFeeBPS_)) / 10000);  ==> will return 0
        (uint256 fee0After, uint256 fee1After) = subtractAdminFees(
            fee0,
            fee1,  //E still 0
            arrakisV2.managerFeeBPS()
        );
        //E fee0After and fee1After will still be zero
        //E amount0 = 0
        //E amount1 = 0
        amount0 += FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
            mintAmount_,
            fee0After +
                IERC20(underlyingPayload_.token0).balanceOf(
                    underlyingPayload_.self
                ) -
                arrakisV2.managerBalance0(),
            totalSupply_
        );
        amount1 += FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
            mintAmount_,
            fee1After +
                IERC20(underlyingPayload_.token1).balanceOf(
                    underlyingPayload_.self
                ) -
                arrakisV2.managerBalance1(),
            totalSupply_
        );
    }
```

`Amount0 = (mintAmount_ * fee1After( = 0) + mintAmount_ *  (token0.balanceOf(ArrakisV2Vault) -              arrakisV2.managerBalance0()))/ totalSupply`
=>  `Amount0 = mintAmount_ *  (token0.balanceOf(ArrakisV2Vault) - arrakisV2.managerBalance0()) / totalSupply`

`Amount1 = ((mintAmount_ * fee1After( = 0) + mintAmount_ *  (token1.balanceOf(ArrakisV2Vault) -              arrakisV2.managerBalance0()))/ totalSupply`
=> `Amount1 = mintAmount_ *  (token1.balanceOf(ArrakisV2Vault) -  arrakisV2.managerBalance0()) / totalSupply`

3. Malicious user mints lpShares for practically nothing 
4. as there is no range defined on this vault, `UniV3pool.mint()` won't be called.

So if there is no ranges defined on the Vault when someone call `ArrakisV2.sol#mint()` he will be able to mint `lpShares` for almost nothing. 

Then with this free minted lpshares, we can easily imagine someone waiting that the pool contains a lot of UniV3 positions to withdraw it's tokens and then gain token0,token1 amount for Free

Moreover, even if it's a small amount, amount0 and amount1 tokens will stay in the vault and potentially disrupt further calculations using tokenX.balanceOf(ArrakisV2Vault)...

## Impact

An attacker could potentially accumulate an unjustified share of the liquidity pool, without providing a lot of liquidity, and subsequently drain funds from the pool, impacting other liquidity providers.
Can be done by frontRunning the first `ArrakisV2.sol#rebalance()` call or simply by calling `ArrakisV2.sol#mint()` just after first mint has been processed by the vault owner

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a require() statement to check that the _range array is not empty at the start of the `ArrakisV2.sol#mint()` or of the `Underlying.sol#totalUnderlyingForMint()` function. This would ensure that shares cannot be minted without providing the corresponding liquidity.
`require(_ranges.length > 0, "No range set");`
