# Inconsistent mint prices can be gamed

## Summary
A user mints Arrakis pool tokens by calling `ArrakisV2.mint()`. The required amount of `token0` and `token1` are calculated and finally transferred in from the caller. A user can secure a better mint price than other users if they currently have fees to claim because of the way that the required amounts are calculated in `Underlying.totalUnderlyingForMint()`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The amount of `token0` required for minting `mintAmount_` is calculated as:

```solidity
amount0 += FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
    mintAmount_,
    fee0After +
        IERC20(underlyingPayload_.token0).balanceOf(
            underlyingPayload_.self
        ) -
        arrakisV2.managerBalance0(),
    totalSupply_
);
```
Where `fee0After` is the amount of fees due to Arrakis if it were to collect the pending fees at this instant.

Both the pending fees yet to be collected and the current token balance are used in the calculation. Therefore, if a user currently holds Arrakis shares and has pending to claim, they can claim their pending which will reduce the mint price. If another user simply minted shares, they would receive the higher price. This is easiest understood with an example.

**Calculation Assumptions:**
- `totalSupply_` = 1000
- `mintAmount_` = 100
- `fee0After` = 50
- Arrakis token balance = 0
- Manager fee = 0
- ASSUMPTION: The minting user holds 50% of total supply (500 Arrakis tokens)
- ASSUMPTION: Manager fee BPS = 0 (for easy calculation)

***Normal user mint:***
`amount0` = `100 * (50 + 0 - 0) / 1000 = **5**

***Existing user mint:***
- They claim their pending.
- 25 fee tokens transfer to user.
- 25 fee tokens remain in Arrakis contract.

`amount0` = `100 * (0 + 25 - 0) / 1000 = **2.5** (Ignore precision loss for example)

As shown above, the claimed pending tokens are removed from both the pending owed to the Arrakis contract AND the Arrakis token balance itself. This discrepancy leads to better prices for existing shareholders who claim right before minting.

**NOTE:** Claiming pending tokens is performed by calling `ArrakisV2.burn()`. The user would need to burn at least `1 wei` of shares for the claim to succeed.

***MALICIOUS IMPACT***
A malicious actor can backrun incoming `mint()` calls. The following will occur:
- New user mints pool tokens at price X.
- Malicious actor claims their tokens and mints pool tokens at price X-Y.
- Malicious actor burns their pool tokens. The malicious actor effectively steals value from the difference in mint prices.

## Impact
- Inconsistent mint prices for users lead to loss of funds.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of using the combination of pending fees and current token balance, perhaps implement an `accGrowthPerShare` system. This would ensure that a user's claimable balance can not affect the current minting price.
