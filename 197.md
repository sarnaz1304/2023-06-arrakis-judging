# Risk with calling the rebalance() function before the initManagement()

## Summary
The `rebalance()` function is designed to rebalance a vault managed by the `SimpleManager` contract. However, if the `rebalance` function is called before the corresponding `initManagement()` function is called for that specific vault, it may lead to unexpected behavior or may cause issues with the vault's state or balances. This is because the `initManagement()` function initializes the necessary parameters and settings for the vault to be managed by the `SimpleManager`.

## Vulnerability Detail
See Summary.

## Impact
Potential consequences could include:
- Incorrect rebalancing of the vaultinconsistent state between the vault and the SimpleManager contract,
- Unexpected errors that disrupt the normal operation of the protocol.

These issues could affect the security, functionality, and performance of the ArrakisV2 protocol.

## Recommendation
Consider implementing safeguards such as enforcing a specific order of function calls or adding checks within the rebalance function to ensure that the initManagement function has been called prior to rebalancing.
