# Hardcoded  GRACE_PERIOD_TIME(12 hours) won't be the same on chains like  optimism

## Summary
blockTime can be shorter on some L2's.

## Vulnerability Detail
On Mainnet it takes 12s to mine a single block, and a minute to mine 5 blocks. so hardcoded [GRACE_PERIOD_TIME()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-manager-templates/contracts/oracles/ChainLinkOracle.sol#L15) which is 3600 here is 12 hours (_it is gotten like this_: 5x60x12). 

But on optimism it takes 2s to mine a single block, and a minute to mine 30 blocks. Therefore 12 hours will be 21600 (30x60x12)

Hardcoded  GRACE_PERIOD_TIME(3600) will be less than 12 hours on optimism

## Impact
Hardcoded  GRACE_PERIOD_TIME(3600) will be less than 12 hours on optimism

## Recommendation
don't hardcode blocktime in a multichain project.
