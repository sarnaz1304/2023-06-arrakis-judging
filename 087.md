# Same owner is set after transferring ownership.

## Summary
The address of the new owner should be set when transferring ownership and not the owner. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The simplemanager , arakisv2factorystorage and arakisv2beacon pass in the address of the owner instead of the new owner.
        _transferOwnership(owner_);

## Impact
Ownership will not be transferred.
