# Discordant managerFeeBps

## Summary
It is possible for the `managerFeeBPS` on the SimpleManager to be different from the `managerFeeBPS` on the vault. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The SimpleManager internally (in the `vaults` mapping) stores the `managerFeeBPS` but it can become misaligned with the source of truth - the `managerFeeBPS` on the vault. For example, the owner can set a new manager which then proceeds to call `setManagerFeeBPS`. The owner can then set the manager back to the original and now the fees between the manager and vault disagree.
## Impact
The manager could lose out or make more fees than expected. Users may believe the manager charges X "commission" but in reality Y is charged -- potentially leading to loss of assets.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
/// @notice set manager
/// @param manager_ manager address.
/// @dev only callable by owner.
function setManager(address manager_) external onlyOwner {
    _withdrawManagerBalance();
    manager = manager_;
    emit LogSetManager(manager_);
}
```
```solidity
/// @notice set manager fee bps
/// @param managerFeeBPS_ manager fee in basis points.
/// @dev only callable by manager.
function setManagerFeeBPS(uint16 managerFeeBPS_) external onlyManager { <--- can be called directly on vault
    require(managerFeeBPS_ <= 10000, "MFO");
    managerFeeBPS = managerFeeBPS_;
    emit LogSetManagerFeeBPS(managerFeeBPS_);
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Reconsider whether the manager has to even store the `managerFeeBPS` internally and just query from the vault if truly needed.
