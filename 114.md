# Indeterminacy in Vault address generation could lead to unexpected addresses

## Summary
Vault contracts are deployed in a similar fashion to Uniswap, utilizing the `create2` opcode. This is designed to ensure that the Vault contract address is predictable and consistent, as certain scenarios necessitate knowing the pool address in advance for operations. However, the existing implementation may not provide a completely deterministic Vault contract address.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the usage of `block.number` and `numVaults() + 1` in the `_preDeploy()` function. This function is responsible for computing the address of the pre-deployed contract and deploying it using `create2`. It's impractical to predict the block number where the transaction will be confirmed. Similarly, using `numVaults()`, which retrieves `_vaults.length()` from contract storage, introduces unpredictability. The `_vaults` variable could be altered by preceding transactions that modify it, causing the final vault address to deviate from the calculated one.

## Impact
This indeterminacy could cause users and contracts to use incorrect Vault addresses, which can potentially result in errors or loss of tokens.

## Recommendation
Instead of using `block.number` and `numVaults() + 1` to calculate the `create2` salt, consider alternative methods that can provide deterministic results, ensuring the consistency of the Vault address generation.
