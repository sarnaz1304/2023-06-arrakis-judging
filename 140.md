# No slippage protection in vaults results in users losing their funds

## Summary

There is no slippage protection when minting/burning from a vault. A user has no way to know how many funds will be transferred to mint or burn N shares.

## Vulnerability Detail

A similar issue applies to the `burn` function, but this issue will describe just the `mint` function for the sake of brevity.

In `mint`, users are able to choose how many shares they want to mint, but they can't choose how much it will cost them to do so:

```solidity
// transfer amounts owed to contract
if (amount0 > 0) {
    token0.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, me, amount0);
}
if (amount1 > 0) {
    token1.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, me, amount1);
}
```

The issue can be replicated in the following way:

1. A user gives max allowance to the vault for `token0`
2. They call the `mint` function in `ArrakisV2` with a `mintAmount_ = 1e18`
3. With current market conditions they expect to pay `1e18 token0` for their shares
4. Due to a fluctuation, the actual amount is way higher than what they expect when the transaction is finally executed
5. The user has lost more than intended, this can be further amplified by MEV bots that sandwich their transaction

## Impact
High as the user can easily lose a substantial amount of funds without prerequisites, as it's very common for users (especially non-technical) to give max allowance for a token in DeFi.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding an `amountMax` to the `mint` function to let users decide the max amount of funds that will be sent to the vault to mint their shares.

Consider adding an `amountMin` to the `burn` function to let users decide the min amount of funds that will be received from the vault to burn their shares.

Consider also adding a `deadline` parameter to avoid having stale transactions in the mempool that may be later executed at a worse price.
