# Protocol pause can be bypassed

## Summary
The protocol can pause ArrakisV2Router during extreme circumstances preventing prohibiting key functionalities such as addling liquidity to a vault. However, this pause can be bypassed by users directly interacting with the vault core contract. 
## Vulnerability Detail
In ArraksiV2Router.sol, protocol pause is implemented through a modifier `whenNotPaused()`.
```solidity
//ArrakisV2Router.sol-addliquidity()
   function addLiquidity(
        AddLiquidityData memory params_
    )
        external
        payable
|>      whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1, uint256 sharesReceived)
    {...
```
```solidity
//ArrakisV2.sol-mint()
    function mint(
        uint256 mintAmount_,
        address receiver_
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
..
```
However, a malicious user can bypass this modifier by interacting with the core ArrakisV2.sol to mint or burn liquidity and receive profits because there is no pause mechanism implemented in the core contract.
## Impact
Protocol on pause can be easily bypassed, causing users to mint and burn liquidity and claim profits in a way unsafe to the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In ArrakisV2.sol, implement a check to query protocol pausing state from the router contract in key functions such as `mint()` and `burn()`. This will ensure that when the protocol is paused on the router, any attempt to mint and burn through the core vault contract will be reverted.
