# The `ArrakisV2Storage.setManager()` function does not have `nonReentrant` modifier

## Summary

The [ArrakisV2Storage.setManager()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L209) function does not have a non re-entrant protection, this could be a problem because a malicious manager can make some actions before is removed via the [_withdrawManagerBalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L210) function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [ArrakisV2Storage.setManager()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L209) function helps to the owner to set a new manager. Before the manager is changed, it send his rewards via [_withdrawManagerBalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L280-L286). 

The problem is that if the `token0` or `token1` are an ERC777, the removed manager can reenter to the contracts, making some malicious actions before he is removed from the authorized management.

## Impact

The removed manager can re-enter and make favorable trades.

## Code Snippet

The [setManager()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L209) function:

```solidity
    function setManager(address manager_) external onlyOwner {
        _withdrawManagerBalance();
        manager = manager_;
        emit LogSetManager(manager_);
    }
```

The [_withdrawManagerBalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L280-L286):

```solidity
    function _withdrawManagerBalance() internal {
        uint256 amount0 = managerBalance0;
        uint256 amount1 = managerBalance1;

        managerBalance0 = 0;
        managerBalance1 = 0;

        if (amount0 > 0) {
            token0.safeTransfer(manager, amount0);
        }

        if (amount1 > 0) {
            token1.safeTransfer(manager, amount1);
        }

        emit LogWithdrawManagerBalance(amount0, amount1);
    }
```
