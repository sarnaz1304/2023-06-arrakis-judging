# Use of Solidity version 0.8.13 which has few issues applicable to Arrakis


## Summary

The extensive usage of Solidity version 0.8.13 in the development of ArrakisFinance contracts, including ArrakisV2 and ChainLinkOraclePivot among others, has unveiled notable risks due to known vulnerabilities associated with this specific compiler version. These vulnerabilities pertain mainly to two issues:

1. **Optimizer Bug Regarding Memory Side Effects of Inline Assembly**: OpenZeppelin contracts, from which ArrakisFinance contracts inherit, make use of inline assembly. The Solidity 0.8.13 version, when used with optimization, has been found to contain bugs associated with memory side effects of inline assembly (Reference: [Solidity 0.8.15 Release Announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/06/15/solidity-0.8.15-release-announcement/)).

2. **ABI-encoding Vulnerability**: There are also reported bugs related to ABI-encoding in this version of the compiler (Reference: [Solidity 0.8.14 Release Announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/05/18/solidity-0.8.14-release-announcement/)). This can be seen from the use of abi.encoding in [Position.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/9594cf930307ebbfe5cae4f8ad9e9b40b26c9fec/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Position.sol#L26), [ArrakisV2Factory.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/9594cf930307ebbfe5cae4f8ad9e9b40b26c9fec/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2Factory.sol#L111), etc.

NB: This report is more inclined to the first issue and the second is just attached

## Vulnerability Detail

The following details provide further context on the vulnerabilities:

1. **Optimizer Bug Regarding Memory Side Effects of Inline Assembly**: This bug pertains to a malfunction in the compiler when handling inline assembly, leading to potential memory issues that can affect the correctness of the contract execution. Detailed information about this bug can be found in this official Solidity post: [Optimizer Bug Regarding Memory Side Effects of Inline Assembly](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/06/15/inline-assembly-memory-side-effects-bug/).

2. **ABI-encoding Vulnerability**: This vulnerability revolves around the mishandling of ABI-encoded data which could lead to incorrect transaction processing or potential security issues. Take a look at the [Solidity 0.8.14 Release Announcement](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2022/05/18/solidity-0.8.14-release-announcement/)

## Impact

The presence of these bugs could lead to incorrect computation and data handling, given the sensitive nature of inline assembly, any malfunctions could lead to unpredictable contract behaviors.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerabilities can be found in multiple instances, including but not limited to:

Manual Audit

## Recommendation

The simplest and most effective mitigation strategy is to transition to a more recent, secure version of the Solidity compiler devoid of the identified bugs.
