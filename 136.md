# Contracts never initialize Ownable

## Summary
Ownable is not initialized after importing the OZ OwnableUpgradeable in the `ArrakisV2Storage` contract and the `ArrakisV2FactoryStorage` contract and this can break the core functionality of the protocol leaving it susceptible to attacks as they are other contracts in the proctocol inheriting them.
## Vulnerability Detail
Failure to call the initialize ownable during the initialization process of an upgradeable contract can lead to access control issues, Lack of Ownership, Inconsistent State issues etc because without calling Ownable_init(), the owner variable in OwnableUpgradeable will not be set and any function marked with the onlyOwner modifier can be called by anyone 
## Impact
The `addPools` function, `removePools` function, `whitelistRouters` function, `blacklistRouters` function, `setRestrictedMint` and `setManager` function can be called by anyone since the ownable function wasn't initialized. These are all important functions and you can also see that functions like setManager that sets the manager that should be set by onlyOwner is also compromised leaving the managerial position compromised and leaving the onlyManager modifier useless and this goes ahead to also leave all the functions marked with onlyManager useless too.

## Recommendation
Initialize the ownable function ( Ownable_init() ) during the contract initialization process
