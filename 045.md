# Remove liquidity whenNotPaused protection is useless

## Summary
The protocol implements pausing on all public features through the `ArrakisV2Router`. However since burning on ArrakisV2 is not restricted to the router, and not using `whenNotPaused`, a user can burn liquidity even when the protocol is paused. 

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see that there is no access control of any kind on the function burn in ArrakisV2:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L162-L165

So even though the function `removeLiquidity` in ArrakisV2Router is paused:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L201-L205

A user can call burn directly on ArrakisV2, and remove his share of liquidity, rendering the pause feature useless on `removeLiquidity` in the router.

## Impact
Protocol pause protection on liquidity removal is rendered useless by lack of access control on vaults

## Recommendation
Restrict the burn function to the router when using the public vault setup (`restrictedMint`)
