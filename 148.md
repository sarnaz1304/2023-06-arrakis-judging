# Users will lose earned fee profits in the vault when burning vault shares due to incorrect calculation

## Summary
When a user burns their vault share, their entitled liquidity fee profits are incorrectly accounted causing them to lose profits to the vault.
## Vulnerability Detail
In ArrakisV2.sol `burn()`, when a user burns vault shares, liquidity of all active ranges of the vault will be accounted for. Users are entitled to a portion of the total vault liquidity based on the ratio of `burnAmount_` to `totalSupply()`. 
```solidity
//ArrakisV2.sol-burn()
...
        for (uint256 i; i < _ranges.length; i++) {
            Range memory range = _ranges[i];
            IUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(
                factory.getPool(address(token0), address(token1), range.feeTier)
            );
            uint128 liquidity = Position.getLiquidityByRange(
                pool,
                address(this),
                range.lowerTick,
                range.upperTick
            );
            if (liquidity == 0) continue;

|>            liquidity = SafeCast.toUint128(
                FullMath.mulDiv(liquidity, burnAmount_, ts)
            );
            Withdraw memory withdraw = _withdraw(
                pool,
                range.lowerTick,
                range.upperTick,
                liquidity
            );
...
```
In `_withdraw()`, user-entitled liquidity calculated from above is converted into the form of token0 and token1 amounts and returned as `burn0` and `burn1`. The liquidity fees generated by this liquidity are returned as `fee0` and `fee1`.  All tokens including earned fees are transferred back to the vault at this point, which is reflected in `balanceOf(address(this))`.
```solidity
//ArrakisV2.sol-_withdraw()
...
       withdraw.fee0 = collect0 - withdraw.burn0;
        withdraw.fee1 = collect1 - withdraw.burn1;
...
```
Back in `burn()`, the leftover token balances in the vault are calculated as `leftOver0` and `leftOver1` based on `balanceOf(address(this))`. However, there is an error in the accounting here. 
```solidity
//ArrakisV2.sol-burn()
...
        _applyFees(total.fee0, total.fee1);
|>        uint256 leftOver0 = token0.balanceOf(address(this)) -
            managerBalance0 -
            total.burn0;
|>        uint256 leftOver1 = token1.balanceOf(address(this)) -
            managerBalance1 -
            total.burn1;
         amount0 = FullMath.mulDiv(leftOver0, burnAmount_, ts);
         amount1 = FullMath.mulDiv(leftOver1, burnAmount_, ts);
          amount0 += total.burn0;
          amount1 += total.burn1;
        if (amount0 > 0) {
            token0.safeTransfer(receiver_, amount0);
        }
        if (amount1 > 0) {
            token1.safeTransfer(receiver_, amount1);
        }
...
```
Because at this point `balanceOf(address(this))` is already increased by `burn0` and `burn1` as well as `fee0` and `fee1`, both burned amount and earned fee amount need to be accounted for. But the calculation only accounted for the burned amount, leaving the user-earned fees as part of the leftover to be shared by other users. This means a user's profits (post manager fee deduction) are always further reduced.

## Impact
Users will lose profit when they burn vault shares. This is especially damaging when the user burned share amount is relatively small compared to total vault shares, because the user will only get back a small fraction of their earned liquidity fees. And the small fraction is disproportional to the liquidity they burned. 

Suppose this example based on current implementation:

(1)userA burned 100 ether shares and those burned liquidity generated 0.1 ether fee(post manager fee deduction) in the uniswap pool, and there is 1000 ether in total supply in the vault, so user entitled profit (assuming currently no existing leftover profits in the pool) is 0.01 ether (only 10% of userA earned fees).

(2)Afterward, userB burned their 100 ether shares and generated 0.1 ether fee(post manager fee deduction) in uniswap, and now there is 900 ether in total supply, the userA lost 0.09 ether profits to the vault, so userB now can claim (0.09+0.1)x(100/900)= 0.02 ether (only 20% of userB earned fees). 

(3)Then userC mints 500 ether shares in the vault. Now the vault total supply is 1300 ether.

(4)Then userD burned 100 ether shares and generated 0.1 ether fee(post manager fee deduction) in uniswap, and now there is 1300 ether total supply. Because both userA and userB lost their profits in the vault 0.1-0.01+0.1-0.02=0.17 ether, now userD can claim (0.1+0.17)x(100/1300)=0.02 ether. (only 20% of userD earned fees). 

As seen above, users most likely only get a small fraction of their profits while losing a much bigger portion of their profits in the pool. Although the leftover profit theoretically accumulates, it's likely not enough to compensate at all. This is because (1) the users would have already lost profits when burning their shares before leftover accumulates enough as seen from the example (2) there will always be other users minting to the vault to increase the denominator of profit sharing which significantly further reduces a user's share of leftover profits in the vault. (3) it's most likely there will be much more shares deposited as liquidity at a given time than the amount of shares users are currently burning for profits, which means the denominator is likely too large for a user to benefit from accumulated profits. So whoever is trying to burn shares for profits will almost certainly lose.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
(1) Update `total.fee0` and `total.fee1` to reflect user earned fee post manager fee deduction.
(2) Then change leftover calculations into: `uint256 leftOver0 = token0.balanceOf(address(this)) -
            managerBalance0 -
            total.burn0-total.fee0;`
(3) Then add the user-earned fee on top of the burned amount and leftover share: ` amount0 += total.burn0 + total.fee0`
