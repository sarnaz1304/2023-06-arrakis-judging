# `ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol` does not work properly if the update intervals (the heartbeat) of the two used oracles is different

## Summary
In the contract `ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol` the variable `outdated` is used to avoid stale prices from oracles. To determine the price two oracles are used that use the same `outdated` variable. If the heartbeat of the two oracles are different, the protection from stale prices will not be given or the function `_getLatestRoundData` will revert most of the time.    

## Vulnerability Detail

Example:
In `ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol` two price feeds are used which have different heartbeat. One heartbeat is 1 hour and the other one is 24 hours. If the variable `outdated` is set to 1 hour it will protect from stale prices of the first oracle, but it will revert 23 hours a day once the last update of the second oracle is older than 1 hour. If the variable `outdated` is set to 24 hours, finding the price will work all the time but it will not protect from stale price of the first oracle since its heartbeat is only 1 hour.    


## Impact
Depending on which heartbeat is set for the variable `outdated` (longer heartbeat or shorter heartbeat), the protection against stale prices is not given or the function ` getLatestRoundData` will revert most of the time making the oracles unusable most of the time.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a second variable `outdated2` to the contract so each oracle used has its own time that determines when the price of the oracle is outdated
