# ArrakisV2 may not take manager fee for tokens with low decimals

## Summary
ArrakisV2 may not take manager fee for tokens with low decimals. Because of that manager will not receive all fees.
## Vulnerability Detail
When `burn` function is called, then it loops through the all ranges, in order to withdraw it from uniswap for user.
Also fees for each range [is collected](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L433-L439).

For their job, managers can get a fee which is handled [by `_applyFees` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L208).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L445-L449
```solidity
    function _applyFees(uint256 fee0_, uint256 fee1_) internal {
        uint16 mManagerFeeBPS = managerFeeBPS;
        managerBalance0 += (fee0_ * mManagerFeeBPS) / hundredPercent;
        managerBalance1 += (fee1_ * mManagerFeeBPS) / hundredPercent;
    }
```
As you can see this function just takes manager's percentage out of max 10_000 bips.

Fees that are collected can be not big at all, because they are collected each burn and rebalance(with burn) call.
Some tokens that have low decimals amount as GUSD(2 decimals) in this case may not work as expected.

For example, manager has fee of 0.5%, which is 50 bips.
And during collect, 1$ were earned in GUSD, which is 100 tokens.
Then fee = 100 * 50 / 10000, which will give 0 amount for the manager. 
But if you compare this with usdc token which uses 6 decimals, then in this case manager will receive fee for same 1$ of collected fees.
## Impact
Manager will not receive fair fees for some tokens.

## Recommendation
Don't know how to handle it. Looks like managers should be announced, that low decimals tokens may have less fees payouts for them.
