# Calculation of `poolPrice` in `SimpleManager::rebalance` may revert due to overflow

## Summary

Calculation of `poolPrice` in `SimpleManager::rebalance` may revert due to overflow

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function `SimpleManager::rebalance`, the calculation of `poolPrice` is done as follows:

```solidity
            uint256 poolPrice = FullMath.mulDiv(
                sqrtPriceX96 * sqrtPriceX96,
                10 ** token0Decimals,
                2 ** 192
            );
```

This will revert in cases where `sqrtPriceX96` is a high value. The issue is compounded by the fact that there is also an additional multiplication done with `10 ** token0Decimals` which further lowers the threshold at which overflow would occur.
 
## Impact

Rebalancing would be impossible in certain cases.
