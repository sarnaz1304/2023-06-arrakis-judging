# ChainLinkOraclePivot uses the same `outdated` variable for both price feeds

## Summary

ChainLinkOraclePivot uses the same `outdated` variable for both price feeds.

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol uses Chainlink price feeds as a price oracle. It also checks if the timestamp of the last price provided by oracle is not outdated due to a hardcoded `outdated` variable:
```solidity
File: ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol
246:             require(
247:                 block.timestamp - updatedAt <= outdated, // solhint-disable-line not-rely-on-time
248:                 "ChainLinkOracle: priceFeedA outdated."
249:             );
``` 

However different Chainlink price feeds have different heartbeat times, for example, USDC/USD price could be the same for up to 24 hours if the price is not moving off the threshold:
https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/usdc-usd

At the same time, ETH/USD price would be renewed each hour:
https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd

This means that using the same `outdated` variable for both price feeds makes it inefficient. ETH/USD price would be stale (if the `outdated` variable would be equal to 24 hours) or the call to USDC/USD feed would revert often  (if the `outdated` variable would be equivalent to 1 hour).

## Impact

Using the same `outdated` variable for both price feeds that could have different heartbeats makes it inefficient leading to a stale price or breaking oracle functionality.

## Recommendation

Consider using different `outdated` variables for each price feed in `ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol`.
