# Drained funds as a result of reentrancy in addLiquidityPermit2

## Summary
Before updating the state variables or completing other critical operations, addLiquidityPermit2  performs token transfers using the token0.safeTransferFrom and token1.safeTransferFrom functions. These transfers are performed before the _addLiquidity function is called.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises because the token transfers are performed before calling the _addLiquidity function. This means that an attacker could potentially exploit a reentrancy vulnerability in the token contract's transferFrom function or any other external contract called during the token transfer.
## Impact
Malicious contract could exploit this order of operations to reenter the addLiquidityPermit2 function before the state variables are updated or other critical operations are completed. This will lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.
