# Operator rebalance should be rate limited

## Summary

`SimpleManager::rebalance` includes slippage protection during swaps to prevent sandwich attacks. Operator still can gain minimal profits from this slippage with sandwich attack. Since `rebalance` is not rate limited, operator can repeat the rebalacne and sandwich attack to steal the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

The slippage of swap in `SimpleManager::rebalance` determines the maximum profit a sandwich bot can obtain through such swaps.

While the profits obtained through a single `rebalance` operation in a sandwich attack are minimal due to this slippage protection, the operator can repeatedly perform the attack to accumulate profit.

## Impact

Operator can steal the protocol with repeated sandwich attacks.

## Recommendation

Implement a rate limit on the `rebalance` function.
