# Failed Update On Manager Blacklist

## Summary
When the manager is blacklisted for a token that supports blacklist like USDC, manager update will be prevented.
## Vulnerability Detail
Upon a call to `setManager`, the manager balance is withdrawn. However, if the manager is blacklisted, the update cannot happen and the manager loses out on earned assets (fees). 
## Impact

- The manager cannot be upgraded.
- Vault cannot accrue retrievable fees from the point of the blacklist onwards.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
/// @notice set manager
/// @param manager_ manager address.
/// @dev only callable by owner.
function setManager(address manager_) external onlyOwner {
    _withdrawManagerBalance();  <---- will revert here
    manager = manager_;
    emit LogSetManager(manager_);
}
 ```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider sending funds to a holding address if the manager is blacklisted to be claimed later.
