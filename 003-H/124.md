# A minter can lose her funds due to unlimited slippage when providing liquidity on an Arrakis vault

## Summary
A minter can lose her funds due to unlimited slippage when providing liquidity on an Arrakis vault

## Vulnerability Detail
When providing liquidity, it is important to check that liquidity is provided accordingly to actual price.
When this is not checked, it can be akin to exchanging an asset to a very defavorable price;

Let's take a simple example in which a Arrakis Vault based on USDC/WETH pools has two narrow ranges around actual price 1 WETH = 2000USDC:

- First range is on the tick corresponding to 1WETH = 1000USDC, and contains 1000 USDC of Arrakis Liquidity
- Second range is on the tick corresponding to 1WETH = 3000USDC, and contains 1 WETH of Arrakis Liquidity

When the price is 1 WETH = 2000 USDC, a depositor Bob can deposit 1 WETH and 1000 USDC and receive totalSupply of shares.

However if Alice front-runs Bob, and moves the price to 3001 USDC, the narrow range 1/3000 contains 3000 USDC

Bob ends up providing 4000 USDC to receive totalSupply of shares.

Alice backruns and brings the price back to 1/2000:

- First range contains 2000 USDC
- Second range contains 2 WETH

Bob having 50% of the shares has the equivalent of 1000 USDC and 1 WETH, and has effectively swapped 3000 USDC for 1 WETH.

Alice has swapped 1 WETH for 3000 USDC, and made 1000 USDC profit at the expense of Bob.

## Impact
Users are exposed to unbounded slippage when minting to an Arrakis Vault

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement various checks to prevent this:
- Price deviation check similar to what exists in rebalance()
- minAmounts check (minAmount0 and minAmount1)
- check minLiquidity minted
