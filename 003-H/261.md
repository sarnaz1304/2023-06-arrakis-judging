# No maxInput amounts during `mint()`

## Summary
Users mint Arrakis pool tokens by calling `ArrakisV2.mint()`. This function takes a `mintAmount_` parameter which is used to calculate the required amounts of token0 and token1 that are transferred from the user. This function does not have any maxInput parameters for either token 0 or token1. Therefore, the contract will pull as many tokens as needed (assuming user approval and balance) depending on the current state of the contract.

If a malicious actor were to front-run a `mint()` call, they would be able to inflate the number of tokens pulled from the user via sending tokens directly to the Arrakis contract or performing a swap in UniV3 to accumulate fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
The required amounts of token0 and token1 are calculated within the `mint()` function as so:

```solidity
            (amount0, amount1) = UnderlyingHelper.totalUnderlyingForMint(
                UnderlyingPayload({
                    ranges: _ranges,
                    factory: factory,
                    token0: address(token0),
                    token1: address(token1),
                    self: me
                }),
                mintAmount_,
                ts
            );
```

This calls the `Underlying.sol` library:

```solidity
        amount0 += FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
            mintAmount_,
            fee0After +
                IERC20(underlyingPayload_.token0).balanceOf(
                    underlyingPayload_.self
                ) -
                arrakisV2.managerBalance0(),
            totalSupply_
        );
```

The amount of token0 that will be pulled from the user is dependent on:
- The user-supplied `mintAmount_`
- The amount of tokens currently in UniV3 positions (not shown in above code)
- The amount of pending fees that Arrakis can claim from UniV3
- The total supply of Arrakis pool tokens

Therefore, the amount of tokens pulled from the user can be inflated if anyone:
- Swaps in UniV3 to incur more fees for Arrakis positions
- Sends tokens directly to the Arrakis contract

These impacts constitute a griefing attack that would not be profitable for the attacker. That said, max input parameters should be used to ensure that users do not spend more tokens than originally desired.

## Impact
- Unlimited amount of tokens can be pulled from users on `mint()`

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `maxAmount0` and `maxAmount1` parameters to the `mint()` function. Revert if the required amounts for either token0 or token1 are higher than the max input amounts.
