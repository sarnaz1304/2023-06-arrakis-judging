# Amounts given in during mint are unbounded and vulnerable to front-runs

## Summary
There is no max amount check on public mint, meaning that an arbitrary amount of tokens can be transferred from depositor to the vault when providing liquidity

## Vulnerability Detail
After initial provided liquidity by the owner we can see that amount0 and amount1 to provide are simply computed using spot data from underlying pool or vault balances:

These amounts are later transferred without further checks from depositor address:

In case the deposit transaction is front-run this means that any amount of token approved by the user can be transferred to the contract.
This is dramatic design for popular tokens, especially if the default is to give unlimited approval to the contract to spare some gas when regularly interacting with it.

## Impact
A user can get extracted more tokens than she expects when minting liquidity on Arrakis

## Recommendation
Add parameters `maxAmount1In` and `maxAmount0In` on `mint` and check `amount0 <= maxAmount0In` and `amount1 <= maxAmount1In`
