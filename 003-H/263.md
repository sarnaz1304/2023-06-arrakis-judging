# No `minAmountOut` parameters on `burn()` can lead to unfavorable slippage

## Summary
When you burn liquidity in a UniswapV3 position, the proportion of token0 and token1 depend on the liquidity ticks of the position and the current price relationship of the token pair. Therefore, calling `ArrakisV2.burn()` will return a variable amount of token0 and token1 depending on the current state of the liquidity positions and the pair price. `minAmountOut` parameters should be introduced to protect users against wild swings in the proportion of returned tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail
***Example WETH/USDC pool:***
- Current WETH/USDC price = **$1900**
- Single position ticks set at `1800` and `2000`
- Current liquidity represents 50% WETH and 50% USDC

*A users attempts to burn their Arrakis pool tokens.*

- A mega whale swap pushes the price to **$1800**.
- Now the liquidity represents 100% WETH and 0% USDC.
- The user burns their position and receives only WETH.

Perhaps the user would rather wait until the price moves back up so that more of token1 is returned to them.

`ArrakisV2.sol` performs the burning of liquidity within its `_withdraw()` function:

```solidity
function _withdraw(
    IUniswapV3Pool pool_,
    int24 lowerTick_,
    int24 upperTick_,
    uint128 liquidity_
) internal returns (Withdraw memory withdraw) {
    (withdraw.burn0, withdraw.burn1) = pool_.burn(
        lowerTick_,
        upperTick_,
        liquidity_
    );


    (uint256 collect0, uint256 collect1) = pool_.collect(
        address(this),
        lowerTick_,
        upperTick_,
        type(uint128).max,
        type(uint128).max
    );


    withdraw.fee0 = collect0 - withdraw.burn0;
    withdraw.fee1 = collect1 - withdraw.burn1;
}
```

As seen above, it calls `pool.burn()` directly without any minOutput parameters. Compare this to Uniswap's official `NonfungiblePositionManager.decreaseLiquidity()` function:

```solidity
function decreaseLiquidity(DecreaseLiquidityParams calldata params)
    external
    payable
    override
    isAuthorizedForToken(params.tokenId)
    checkDeadline(params.deadline)
    returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
{
    ...

    (amount0, amount1) = pool.burn(position.tickLower, position.tickUpper, params.liquidity);

    require(amount0 >= params.amount0Min && amount1 >= params.amount1Min, 'Price slippage check');
```

There is a direct price slippage check for this same scenario.

## Impact
- Lack of price slippage check allows for return of undesirable token0/token1 ratio

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `minOutput` parameters to `ArrakisV2.burn()` to ensure the user is returned a desirable proportion of tokens.
