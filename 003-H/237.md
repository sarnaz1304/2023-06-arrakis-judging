# Minting lack of slippage protection

## Summary

Minting lack of slippage protection

## Vulnerability Detail

ArrakisV2 mint function is exposed to unlimited slippage, which is a common minting issue which open for potential financial loss when attacker use front-run attack.

```js
File: ArrakisV2.sol
54:     function mint(uint256 mintAmount_, address receiver_)
55:         external
56:         nonReentrant
57:         returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
```

The current implementation of the `mint()` function lacks a slippage control parameter, making it susceptible to front-run attacks. This vulnerability exist when dealing with significant transaction volumes, as it allows malicious actors to manipulate the minting process and create price impact. By manipulating the pool's reserves, a frontrunner can artificially inflate the perceived value of the transferred token, leading to potential financial losses for users.

## Impact

User will be vulnerable to front-run attacks and receive less token from their expectation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Applying a slippage control parameter in the mint() function. This parameter would enable users to specify the acceptable range of price impact during the minting process. Consider adding a minAmountOut parameter.
