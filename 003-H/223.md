# No slippage protection when burning Arrakis V2 shares and withdrawing underlying assets

## Summary

When burning Arrakis V2 shares and withdrawing underlying assets, users can call the function `ArrakisV2.burn`. The function will loop through all ranges and withdraw a portion of liquidity from each pool that has liquidity. However, there is no slippage protection to ensure a fair price for the withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail

When burning Arrakis V2 shares and withdrawing underlying assets, users can call the function `ArrakisV2.burn`. The function will loop through all ranges and withdraw a portion of liquidity from each pool that has liquidity.

        Withdraw memory withdraw = _withdraw(
            pool,
            range.lowerTick,
            range.upperTick,
            liquidity
        );

However, there are no parameters for `amount0Min` and `amount1Min`, which are used to prevent slippage. The function without slippage protection could be vulnerable to a front-running attack which leads to the burn call at an unfavorable price.

Please see link below for recommendation from Uniswap V3:

## Impact

The function is exposed to front-running risk and could decrease liquidity at a distorted price.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement slippage protection variables and check the results with `amount0Min` and `amount1Min` after withdraw.
