# No slippage protection and deadline check in `_swapAndAddLiquidity`

## Summary

`_swapAndAddLiquidity()` function doesn't have deadline checks and slippage protection.

## Vulnerability Detail

Without slippage, If the price of the tokens changes significantly during the swap, it could result in a large slippage, causing users to lose a significant amount of funds.
An attacker can watch the mempool and then (using flash bots) execute a sandwich attack to manipulate the price before and after the swap.

Missing deadline checks allow pending transactions to be maliciously executed in the future. You need to add a deadline parameter to all functions which potentially perform a swap on the user's behalf.

The deadline check ensures that the transaction can be executed on time and that the expired transaction reverts.

## Impact

Swaps will be sandwiched causing a loss of funds or without deadline parameters users can have their operations executed at unexpected times when the market conditions are unfavorable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `minOutputAmount` which can set slippage and introduce a `deadline` parameter to execute the function at the desired time.
