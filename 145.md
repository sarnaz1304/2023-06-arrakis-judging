# SimpleManager won't work or offer slippage protection for some Uniswap pools

## Summary
Based on the precision of uniswap sqrtPriceX96, the way poolPrice is calculated and deviation is checked, there are 3 cases where SimpleManager won't work or offer slippage protection.
1. $sqrtPriceX96^2 * 10^{token0Decimal} < 2^{192}$
2. $sqrtPriceX96^2 * 10^{token0Decimal} > uint256.max$
3. $sqrtPriceX96^2 * 10^{token0Decimal} \div 2^{192} <= 1,000$
Case 1 and 2 would revert while case 3 won't offer deviation and slippage protection

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Uniswap allows `MIN_SQRT_RATIO = 4295128739` but `poolPrice` would be 0 if `sqrtPriceX96 < 7.9e+19 and token0Decimals == 18` or when `sqrtPriceX96 < 7.9e+25 and token0Decimals == 6`. And that would cause division by 0 in `_checkDeviation`.
2. Uniswap allows `MAX_SQRT_RATIO = 1461446703485210103287273052203988822378723970342` (close to 2^160 or 10^48), but poolPrice calculation would revert when `sqrtPriceX96 > 10^29 and token0Decimals == 18` or when `sqrtPriceX96 > 10^23 and token0Decimals == 30`
3. If maxSlippage is 1bp, deviation between 1,000.9 and 1,000.0 would appear to be 0 even though it is 9bp cause they would appear to be 1,000 and 1,000. This is possible as it requires sqrtPriceX96 above case 1.

## Impact
SimpleManager would revert or offer 0 slippage protection for some Uniswap pools.
