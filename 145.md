# Using sqrtPriceX96 won't offer extra protection as expected in SimpleManager

## Summary
sqrtPriceX96 is used to check the deviation of chainlink price feed as a precaution. But sqrtPriceX96 can easily be manipulated within the same block as rebalance transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
If chainlink price has deviated and an operator calls rebalance, an attacker could move sqrtPriceX96 to a point where it doesn't deviate from the chainlink price. Uniswap provides an oracle which is recommended over sqrtPriceX96 because sqrtPriceX96 could be manipulated within the same block and susceptible to flashloan and sandwich.

## Impact
operators could use flashloan to sandwich the vault or an MEV searcher could sandwich an operator just trying to rebalance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use Uniswap oracle which provides TWAP. TWAP are more difficult and costly to manipulate.
