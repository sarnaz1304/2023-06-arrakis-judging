# Missing fallback function could render admin operations impossible.

## Summary

In transparent upgradeable proxy , a  fallback should be implemented so that if msg.sender == admin the call is processed internally to prevent transparently fallback to the proxy behaviour.
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#TransparentUpgradeableProxy

## Vulnerability Detail
No fallback function implemented.

## Impact
admin operations can be inaccessible which could prevent upgradability. also  transparency can be compromised.
