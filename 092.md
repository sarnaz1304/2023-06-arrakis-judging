# Vault rate can be inflated

## Summary
Vault rate can be inflated by minting minimum of shares, then burning everything except 1 wei and donating some big amount of tokens. As result, in order to participate user will have to use big money transactions, which will decrease amount of participants. 
## Vulnerability Detail
It's possible to inflate the rate of ArrakisV2 for first depositor.
Attacker needs to be first minter and provide enough funds [to skip init rate checks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L103-L114). Then in next tx, he will burn everything, but leave 1 wei of vault shares. Then he will donate token0 and token1 to the vault.
As result, the rate is increased. And next depositors, should now pay big amounts [just to mint 1 wei of shares](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol#L72-L89).

As result, less people will be able to participate in such vault, which is some king of dos.
## Impact
Rate is inflated, so in order to participate users should pay big amounts. Less people can participate.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This is not the easiest case. Your init rates somehow dictate the min amount to mint, so user can't mint 1 wei. But also you need somehow disallow withdrawals, that will make total supply very small, but still you need to allow withdraw everyone. Don't know good approach.
