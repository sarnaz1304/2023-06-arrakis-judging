# addLiquidity can be front-runned with financial losses

## Summary
addLiquidity function first performs token transfers using token0.safeTransferFrom and token1.safeTransferFrom before updating the state variables and completing the liquidity addition process. This means that an attacker can monitor pending transactions and front-run the addLiquidity function
## Vulnerability Detail
addLiquidity function first performs token transfers from msg.sender to the contract itself. After the transfers, it calls the internal _addLiquidity function to complete the liquidity addition process.
The issue arises because token transfers are performed before updating the state variables or completing other critical operations. 
An attacker observes a transaction in which addLiquidity is called then quickly submits a new transaction with a higher gas price that also calls addLiquidity, but this time with a slightly different set of parameters, aiming to benefit from the observed transaction.
Since the token transfers happen before updating the state variables, the attacker's transaction gets executed first, allowing them to front-run the original transaction.

## Impact
An  attacker quickly submits a transaction with a higher gas price that transfers a larger amount of one of the tokens to the contract, effectively changing the token price and resulting in financial loses

## Recommendation
Update state variables and complete critical operations before performing any token transfers
