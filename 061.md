# Liquidity is not checked, so the whole rebalance function will revert

## Summary
Liquidity for minting is not checked, so the whole rebalance function will revert.

## Vulnerability 
The part of minting in `rebalance()` function in `ArrakisV2`, IUniswapV3Pool is used to mint new assets, but the liquidity is never checked if it is greater than zero. As we can see in the [UniswapV3Pool mint() function](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L455-L487) will revert if the liquidity is equal to zero.

## Impact
The minting of particular asset will revert and the logic will be broken.
