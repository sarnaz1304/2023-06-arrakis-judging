# XO-The `getProxyAdmin()` function not handle the errors that occur when the `admin()` function is called.

## Summary
- The getProxyAdmin() function  has a vulnerability that not properly handle errors that occur when the `admin()` function is called. it's leading to  someone to take control of the vault and steal its funds if he exploit this vulnerability 
## Vulnerability Detail
-  The `getProxyAdmin()` function is used to retrieve the admin address of a vault so the problem is the `getProxyAdmin()` function does not properly handle errors that occur when the `admin()` function is called.
If the `admin()` function throws an exception, the `getProxyAdmin()` function will not be able to recover and the admin address of the vault will be undefined. This means that can someone prevent the retrieval of the admin address and take control of the vault.
```solidity
function getProxyAdmin(address proxy) external view returns (address) {
        // We need to manually run the static call since the getter cannot be flagged as view
        // bytes4(keccak256("admin()")) == 0xf851a440
        (bool success, bytes memory returndata) = proxy.staticcall(
            hex"f851a440"
        );
        require(success, "PA");
        return abi.decode(returndata, (address));
    }

    /// @notice get vault implementation
    /// @param proxy instance of Arrakis V2.
    /// @return implementation address of Arrakis V2 implementation.
    function getProxyImplementation(address proxy)
        external
        view
        returns (address)
    {
        // We need to manually run the static call since the getter cannot be flagged as view
        // bytes4(keccak256("implementation()")) == 0x5c60da1b
        (bool success, bytes memory returndata) = proxy.staticcall(
            hex"5c60da1b"
        );
        require(success, "PI");
        return abi.decode(returndata, (address));
    }

    // #endregion admin view call.
```
## Impact
- if the someone is able to prevent the retrieval of the admin address, they could take control of the vault and steal its funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- wrapping the `admin()` function in a `try/catch` block. This will ensure that the `getProxyAdmin()` function can continue even if the `admin()` function throws an exception.
