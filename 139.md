# Users are not refunded excess ETH in some cases

## Summary
In most `ArrakisV2Router` functions, users are refunded when they specify a `maxAmount` lower than their `msg.value`, however, this doesn't happen in a function due to a bug.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `addLiquidityPermit2` there is a missing assignment of `isToken0Weth` which will always be false:

```solidity
//@audit isToken0Weth is always false, as it is never assigned
bool isToken0Weth;
_permit2Add(params_, amount0, amount1, token0, token1);

_addLiquidity(
    params_.addData.vault,
    amount0,
    amount1,
    sharesReceived,
    params_.addData.gauge,
    params_.addData.receiver,
    token0,
    token1
);

if (msg.value > 0) {
    if (isToken0Weth && msg.value > amount0) {
        payable(msg.sender).sendValue(msg.value - amount0);
    } else if (!isToken0Weth && msg.value > amount1) {
        payable(msg.sender).sendValue(msg.value - amount1);
    }
}
```

The issue can be replicated in the following way:

1. User uses a vault with a `WETH - TOKEN` pair (can be any token with an unbalanced swap ratio, e.g. `5 ETH <-> 10 TOKEN`)

2. User calls `addLiquidityPermit2` with `token0 = WETH`, `token1 = TOKEN`, `msg.value = 7e18` and `amount0Max = 5e18`

3. The Router swaps `5 WETH` for `10 TOKEN` through the vault. The router should refund `2 WETH` at the end, as `msg.value = 7 ETH`.

4. This line will never execute as `isToken0Weth` is always false:
```solidity
if (isToken0Weth && msg.value > amount0) {
    payable(msg.sender).sendValue(msg.value - amount0);
} 
```

5. The user is not refunded as `msg.value > amount1` is also false (`10e18 > 7e18`), so the user has lost `2 ETH`:

```solidity
else if (!isToken0Weth && msg.value > amount1) {
    payable(msg.sender).sendValue(msg.value - amount1);
}
```

## Impact
Medium/High, as the user expects a refund due to how other functions work, and they lose their funds; but they need to specify a `msg.value > amount0Max`.

## Recommendation

Consider modifying the refunding so that the logic is similar to other functions.
