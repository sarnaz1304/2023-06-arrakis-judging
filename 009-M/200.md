# `RouterSwapExecutor` DoS of tokens like USDT with non zero approvals

## Summary
Due to the fact that `safeIncreaseAllowance` is not compatible with some tokens, like USDT, an attacker can exploit the arbitrary external call in `RouterSwapExecutor.sol`'s `swap` function to set a non-zero approval for this contract, blocking all future users from using this contract to swap those tokens on a selected `swapRouter`.

## Vulnerability Detail

A similar, but more general version of this vulnerability was found in a past [internal audit](https://gist.github.com/kassandraoftroy/6ab217b265b29ce7c33106e5d57bbe4b#1-dos-of-routerswapexecutor-with-non-zero-approvals) and fixed by the introduction of whitelists. However on a [recent commit](https://github.com/ArrakisFinance/v2-periphery/commit/3eaf254bfd540c1ebfd75c2ced3ca914c0488ede) the whitelist was removed and `safeIncreaseAllowance` were added, allowing the vulnerability described below. 

On `RouterSwapExecutor.sol`'s `swap` function an external call is made using the parameters supplied by the caller.

```solidity
(bool success, ) = swapAndAddData_.swapData.swapRouter.call(
    swapAndAddData_.swapData.swapPayload
);
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/RouterSwapExecutor.sol#L57-L59

An attacker can exploit this by setting the `swapAndAddData_.swapData.swapRouter` to the target token address (but not `token0` or `token1` used in the swap) and setting `swapAndAddData_.swapData.swapPayload` to the resulting bytecode from `abi.encodeWithSignature("approve(address,uint256)", swapRouter, 2023)`. This will leave the `RouterSwapExecutor` contract with a non-zero approval to the target `swapRouter`. For most tokens this is harmless, but for tokens that don't allow approving values different than zero when the current approval is not zero (for example USDT), this will block any future users for using the `RouterSwapExecutor` contract to swap the target tokens using the selected `swapRouter`, as the `swap` function will revert when trying to increase the approval.

## Impact
An attacker can permanently block `RouterSwapExecutor` contract from swapping on a arbitrary `swapRouter` tokens that don't allow approving values different than zero when the current approval is not zero, for example USDT.
