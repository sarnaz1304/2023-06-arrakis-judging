# The oracle to get an asset's price based off another asset's data feed possesses a risk

## Summary
Using the same data feed in `ChainLinkOracle.sol` for two different asset opens up unnecessary risks for the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
Using the same data feed in `ChainLinkOracle.sol` and `ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol` for two different asset opens up unnecessary risks for the protocol. I suppose the idea is for 1:1 assets (e.g. stETH and ETH) to be able to use each other's data feeds in case one goes down/ doesn't exist. However, linking two assets in such ways opens up numerous attack vectors as depegs happen.

An example: 
stETH is linked to ETH's Chainlink Data Feeds. stETH depegs and goes down in value. People can now deposit it cheaply, in ArrakisV2 vault and use it with an inflated value, taking what really are undercollateralized loans, draining money from the project.

## Impact
In case an asset is linked to another asset's data feeds and one depegs, ArrakisV2 vault will be drained.
