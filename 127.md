# Users can steal the router's token balance to swap and add liquidity

## Summary
When a user swap and add liquidity through `swapAndAddLiquidity()`, they can steal the router's token balance to swap and then add to liquidity. 
## Vulnerability Detail
This is because the function doesn't check whether `amountInSwap` is not more than what they deposit to the router contract. 

In `swapAndAddLiquidity()`, token0 and token1 are first transferred to the router contract based on `amount0Max` and `amount1Max`. Then in `_swapAndAddLiquidity()`, `amountInSwap` is directly transferred from the router contract to RouterSwapExecutor.sol. 

```solidity
//ArrakisV2Router.sol-swapAndAddLiquidity()
...
 if (
            params_.addData.amount0Max > 0 && (msg.value == 0 || !isToken0Weth)
        ) {
            token0.safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                params_.addData.amount0Max
            );
        }
        if (
            params_.addData.amount1Max > 0 && (msg.value == 0 || isToken0Weth)
        ) {
            token1.safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                params_.addData.amount1Max
            );
        }
(
            amount0,
            amount1,
            sharesReceived,
            amount0Diff,
            amount1Diff
        ) = _swapAndAddLiquidity(params_, token0, token1);
}
```
```solidity
//ArrakisV2Router.sol-_swapAndAddLiquidity()
...
        if (params_.swapData.zeroForOne) {
            token0_.safeTransfer(
                address(swapper),
                params_.swapData.amountInSwap
            );
        } else {
            token1_.safeTransfer(
                address(swapper),
                params_.swapData.amountInSwap
            );
        }
...
```
Then in RouterSwapExecutor.sol, `amountInSwap` will be sent to external AMM to swap for the other token and sent back to the router contract to add liquidity. 

For an attack to be profitable for a user, there are some conditions that need to be met. (1) Since the amount swapped would be more than the user sent to the router, all of user sent swapped tokens (if any ) will be converted to the other token, which means that the user is adding one-sided liquidity to the vault. For the user to get shares for one-sided deposit to the vault, the vault at that point will need to have one-sided liquidity, which is totally possible for uniswap v3 liquidity when spot price moves out of the current liquidity range. (2) There are some tokens in the router, this could be accumulative dust amount or other accidental transfers. And it's possible that both conditions are met which makes it the right timing for the attack.

## Impact
Users can steal token balances in the router contract to add liquidity to the vault.

## Recommendation
Check `amountInSwap` to make sure it's not more than amount0Max(zeroForOne) or amount1Max(!zeroForOne).
