# `underlying()` and  `underlyingMint()` is vulnerable to manipulation

## Summary

`underlying()` and  `underlyingMint()` is vulnerable to manipulation

## Vulnerability Detail

`underlying()` and  `underlyingMint()`  fucntions retrieves the `slot0` data of the Uniswap V3 pool using `underlying_.pool.slot0()`. The `slot0` function returns various parameters of the pool, including the `sqrtPriceX96` value.
`slot0`Â is the most recent data point and is therefore extremely easy to manipulate.

## Impact

`underlying()` and  `underlyingMint()`  can be manipulated to cause a loss of funds for the protocol and other users. A malicious user can use this. An example of this kind of manipulation would be to use large buys/sells to alter the composition of the liquidity pool to make it worth less or more.
A big swap using a flash loan can push the liquidity to one side only.

## Recommendation

Don't use `slot0`. Is better to use TWAP Oracle instead.
