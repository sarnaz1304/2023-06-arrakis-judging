# Use Of `slot0()` of Uniswapv3Pool Contract, Open Up Possible Flashloan Attack.

## Summary
Refer Detail Section

## Vulnerability Detail
`Underlying.sol` contract has 2 `view` functions `totalUnderlyingAtPriceWithFees()` and `underlyingMint()` which use `underlying_.pool.slot0()` for getting current pool status like `(uint160 sqrtPriceX96, int24 tick, , , , , )`.

Attackers can leverage flash swaps to borrow assets from the pool, manipulate the square root price through a series of trades, and then return the borrowed assets. This manipulation impacts on `getUnderlyingBalancesMint()` and `getUnderlyingBalances()`
```solidity
        (amount0, amount1, fee0, fee1) = getUnderlyingBalancesMint(
            positionUnderlying, 
            mintAmount_,
            totalSupply_
        );
```
```solidity
       (amount0, amount1, fee0, fee1) = getUnderlyingBalances(
            positionUnderlying
        );
```
## Impact
The vulnerability allows potential attackers to manipulate the pool parameters, potentially leading to financial loss or other unintended consequences.

## Recommendation
Use a TWAP instead of slot0.
