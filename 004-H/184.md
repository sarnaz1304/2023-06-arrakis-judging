# Usage of slot0 is extremely easy to manipulate

## Summary

Usage of slot0 is extremely easy to manipulate.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Underlying library of Arrakis uses pool.slot0 inside of the underlying view function. The returned values are used in several places in there codebase.

```solidity
(uint160 sqrtPriceX96, int24 tick, , , , , ) = underlying_.pool.slot0();
```

slot0 is the most recent data point and is therefore extremely easy to manipulate.

For example the underlying calculation is used to mint Arrakis V2 shares.

```solidity

(amount0, amount1) = UnderlyingHelper.totalUnderlyingForMint(
                UnderlyingPayload({
                    ranges: _ranges,
                    factory: factory,
                    token0: address(token0),
                    token1: address(token1),
                    self: me
                }),
                mintAmount_,
                ts
            );

```

Also the SimpleManager contract uses slot0 to check deviation, this can possible bypassed by manipulating slot0.

## Impact

Arrakis V2 share price can be manipulated and will cause other users to receive less shares.

## Recommendation

To make any calculation use a TWAP instead of slot0
