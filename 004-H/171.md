# deviation price check can be manipulated

## Summary
Deviation check for mints during rebalance relies on spot price which can easily be manipulated.

## Vulnerability Detail
When an operator does a rebalance using `SimpleManager` they can also mint new positions. To do this the pool must pass a deviation check:

```solidity
File: v2-manager-templates/contracts/SimpleManager.sol

179:            uint256 sqrtPriceX96;
180:
181:            (sqrtPriceX96, , , , , , ) = pool.slot0(); // <-- spot price
182:
183:            uint256 poolPrice = FullMath.mulDiv(
184:                sqrtPriceX96 * sqrtPriceX96,
185:                10 ** token0Decimals,
186:                2 ** 192
187:            );
188:
189:            _checkDeviation(
190:                poolPrice,
191:                oraclePrice,
192:                vaultInfo.maxDeviation,
193:                token1Decimals
194:            );
```

`_checkDeviation` simply checks that the uniswap and oracle price is within a certain limit.

The issue is that the spot price of the pool is used. This can be manipulated thus allowing a mint to happen when it shouldn't.

Or also to stop an operator from doing an rebalance since another large liquidity provider could benefit from getting a greater share of fees from swaps.

## Impact
An operator can mint when they shouldn't by manipulating the pool price. Or an operator could be prevented from doing a rebalance when that could benefit the vault users.

## Code Snippet
See above.

## Recommendation
Consider using a twap price from uniswap which isn't as easy to manipulate.
