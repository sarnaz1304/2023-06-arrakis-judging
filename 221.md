# `sqrtPriceX96` in `Underlying::UnderlyingMint` can be manipulated due to use of `slot0`

## Summary

`sqrtPriceX96` in `Underlying::UnderlyingMint` can be manipulated due to use of `slot0`

## Vulnerability Detail

The value of `sqrtPriceX96` in `Underlying::UnderlyingMint` is gotten from `slot0` of the pool.

```solidity
        (uint160 sqrtPriceX96, int24 tick, , , , , ) = underlying_.pool.slot0();
        bytes32 positionId = Position.getPositionId(
            underlying_.self,
            underlying_.range.lowerTick,
            underlying_.range.upperTick
        );
```

`slot0` is the most recent data point and is therefore easy to manipulate.

Because this function is used to determine, the amounts of tokens required for minting, an attacker could exploit this e.g using a flashloan to either inflate or deflate the value of tokens required.

## Impact

Loss of funds for the protocol and users.

## Recommendation

Additional use of an oracle to verify the price can be used.
