# Reentrancy attack during fee collection in withdrawAndCollectFees() function

## Summary
Reentrancy attack during fee collection in `withdrawAndCollectFees()` function

## Vulnerability Detail
The withdrawAndCollectFees function in the contract is responsible for collecting fees from the vaults and transferring them to the specified target address. However, there is a vulnerability related to reentrancy attacks during the fee collection process. If a malicious contract is set as the target address, it can attempt to exploit reentrancy vulnerabilities by recursively calling back into the SimpleManager contract before the transfer of fees is completed. This can lead to unauthorized manipulation of the contract's state, unexpected behavior, or financial loss.

## Impact
A successful reentrancy attack during fee collection can have significant consequences, including:
- Loss of funds or theft of fees
- Unauthorized modification of the contract's state or balances
- Disruption of normal fee collection and transfer operations

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Use reentrancy guards
- Implement the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern to ensure that external calls are made after internal state updates, preventing reentrant calls.
- Implement proper sequence of operations to ensure that the fee transfer is completed before any further external calls or state modifications.
