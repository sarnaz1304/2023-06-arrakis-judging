# any tokens in `ArrakisV2Router` can be claimed using `removeLiquidity`

## Summary
If there are any tokens in `ArrakisV2Router` they can be taken by any user with `removeLiquidity`

## Vulnerability Detail
In `removeLiquidity` a user passes `params_.vault`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L222-L225
```solidity
File: v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol

222:            IERC20(params_.vault).safeTransferFrom(
223:                msg.sender,
224:                address(this),
225:                params_.burnAmount
```

An attacker can provide fake `params_.vault` that does nothing on `transfer`.

Then in `_removeLiquidity`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L536-L566
```solidity
File: v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol

536:    function _removeLiquidity(RemoveLiquidityData memory removeData_)
537:        internal
538:        returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
539:    {
540:        if (removeData_.receiveETH) {
541:            (amount0, amount1) = IArrakisV2(removeData_.vault).burn(
542:                removeData_.burnAmount,
543:                address(this)
544:            );
545:        } else {
546:            (amount0, amount1) = IArrakisV2(removeData_.vault).burn(
547:                removeData_.burnAmount,
548:                removeData_.receiver
549:            );
550:        }
551:
...
559:
560:        if (removeData_.receiveETH) {
561:            _receiveETH(
562:                IArrakisV2(removeData_.vault),
563:                amount0,
564:                amount1,
565:                removeData_.receiver
566:            );
567:        }
568:    }
```

Here, `removeData_.receiveETH` can be set to true and this will go into `_receiveETH`, using `amount0`/`1` provided by `burn` in the same fake vault contract as above.

And in `_receiveETH`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L706-L732
```solidity
706:    function _receiveETH(
707:        IArrakisV2 vault_,
708:        uint256 amount0_,
709:        uint256 amount1_,
710:        address payable receiver_
711:    ) internal {
712:        IERC20 token0 = vault_.token0();
713:        IERC20 token1 = vault_.token1();
714:        bool wethToken0 = _isToken0Weth(address(token0), address(token1));
715:        if (wethToken0) {
716:            if (amount0_ > 0) {
717:                weth.withdraw(amount0_);
718:                receiver_.sendValue(amount0_);
719:            }
720:            if (amount1_ > 0) {
721:                token1.safeTransfer(receiver_, amount1_);
722:            }
723:        } else {
724:            if (amount1_ > 0) {
725:                weth.withdraw(amount1_);
726:                receiver_.sendValue(amount1_);
727:            }
728:            if (amount0_ > 0) {
729:                token0.safeTransfer(receiver_, amount0_);
730:            }
731:        }
732:    }
```

Here, the fake vault can return whatever `token0`/`1` that are there in the router contract. Using `amount0`/`1` returned from burn. If no, `weth` this can simply be `0`.

## Impact
Any tokens in router can be claimed by anyone. Since proper usage and a properly configured vault shouldn't leave any tokens in the router this is only medium. Mainly because if it is at the fault of the user that they sent tokens to the router by mistake, the protocol should make that clear. Like how uniswap does with explicitly allowing anyone to claim tokens. See below.

## Code Snippet
See above.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Verify that the vault is created by Arrakis factory. This to be fair doesn't really solve it, since anyone can deploy a vault and then upgrade it to whatever contract they want but it increases the gas cost for this "attack".

Or:
Uniswap allows anyone to claim whatever tokens are in the contract but then provides a simple [sweepToken](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/base/PeripheryPayments.sol#L30-L41) call to simplify it and make the intentions clear.
