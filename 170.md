# `manager` might be impossible to change

## Summary
If a vault has `address(0)` as `manager` it might not be possible to change it back.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L209-L213
```solidity
File: v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol

209:    function setManager(address manager_) external onlyOwner {
210:        _withdrawManagerBalance();
211:        manager = manager_;
212:        emit LogSetManager(manager_);
213:    }
```

Before changing `manager` the previous manager balance is withdrawn. The issue here is that if this withdrawal fails `manager` cannot be changed.

If the `manager` is set to `address(0)` most token transfers will fail as well resulting in that if there are fees to be transferred you can never change the manager from `address(0)`.

## Impact
`manager` might be impossible to change since the transfer of manager fees might fail. This could prevent the collection of these fees.

## Code Snippet
See above

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since setting `manager` to `address(0)` is prevented in the initialization it makes sense to prevent it when changing manager as well.

Or, if renouncing manager is a feature, it might be worth making it so that tokens are only withdrawn if `manager != address(0)`.
