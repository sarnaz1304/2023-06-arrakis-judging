# ArrakisV2Router's add and remove liquidity does not have a deadline parameter

## Summary

Adding and removing liquidity has no deadline, which may result in unfavourable trades if the transaction lurks in the mempool for a long time.

## Vulnerability Detail

In ArrakisV2Router.sol, users can add or remove liquidity. Let's look at remove liquidity in particular. `removeLiquidity()` is called first and the user transfers the LP tokens to this address. `_removeLiquidity()` is then called. 

```solidity
            IERC20(params_.vault).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                params_.burnAmount
            );
        }


        (amount0, amount1) = _removeLiquidity(params_);
```

In `_removeLiquidity()`, if one of the token in the token pair is ETH, then LP is burned and token 0 and token 1 is transferred to the contract first. The contract then makes the conversion from WETH to ETH and sends the ETH to the user, together with the other non-ETH token. If none of the pair tokens are ETH, then LP is burned and both tokens are sent directly to the sender. The returned token0 and token1 amount is checked to be above the min price. 

```solidity
    {
        if (removeData_.receiveETH) {
            (amount0, amount1) = IArrakisV2(removeData_.vault).burn(
                removeData_.burnAmount,
                address(this)
            );
        } else {
            (amount0, amount1) = IArrakisV2(removeData_.vault).burn(
                removeData_.burnAmount,
                removeData_.receiver
            );
        }


        require(
            amount0 >= removeData_.amount0Min &&
                amount1 >= removeData_.amount1Min,
            "received below minimum"
        );

```

Throughout the add and removing of liquidity, there is no deadline check. The RemoveLiquidityData struct also do not have a deadline parameter.

```solidity
struct RemoveLiquidityData {
    uint256 burnAmount;
    uint256 amount0Min;
    uint256 amount1Min;
    address vault;
    address payable receiver;
    address gauge;
    bool receiveETH;
}
```

Compare this with an example of an AMM such as uniswap. When removing liquidity from V2,  uniswap has a `deadline` parameter. This parameter is a Unix timestamp after which the transaction will revert.

```solidity
function removeLiquidity(
  address tokenA,
  address tokenB,
  uint liquidity,
  uint amountAMin,
  uint amountBMin,
  address to,
  uint deadline
) external returns (uint amountA, uint amountB);
```

## Impact

The transaction can be in the mempool for a long time if there is huge spikes in transaction rate or low gas input. If minimumOut is set extremely low, the transaction may take the worst slippage, which results in unfavourable trade.

## Recommendation

Recommend setting a deadline parameter and revert the transaction if it passes the deadline.
