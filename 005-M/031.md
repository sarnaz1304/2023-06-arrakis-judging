# The manager can be blacklisted by USDC making impossible to change the `vault manager` and the `manager rewards` can be stuck forever.

## Summary

The [setManager()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L209) function can be blocked if the manager is blacklisted in the USDC contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [setManager()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L209) function helps to [transfer the manager rewards to the manager address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L210) then it [changes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L211) the manager address. The problem here is that the manager address can be [blacklisted](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa2327a938febf5fec13bacfb16ae10ecbc4cbdcf#code#L523) by the USDC contract causing the rewards transfer to be locked and manager address change to be impossible.

## Impact

If the manager address is blacklisted:
- The `setManager()` function will be reverted because the [safeTransfer()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L281) will not be possible since the manager address is blacklisted.
- The manager rewards will be stuck in the `Vault`.
- Change to another manager will not be possible.

## Code Snippet

As you can see in the `setManager()` function, first it will transfer the manager rewards to the manager address, then it will change the manager address. So if the `_withdrawManagerBalance()` function is reverted, the assignation to new manager will be impossible.

```solidity
File: ArrakisV2Storage.sol
209:     function setManager(address manager_) external onlyOwner {
210:         _withdrawManagerBalance();
211:         manager = manager_;
212:         emit LogSetManager(manager_);
213:     }
```

```solidity
File: ArrakisV2Storage.sol
273:     function _withdrawManagerBalance() internal {
274:         uint256 amount0 = managerBalance0;
275:         uint256 amount1 = managerBalance1;
276: 
277:         managerBalance0 = 0;
278:         managerBalance1 = 0;
279: 
280:         if (amount0 > 0) {
281:             token0.safeTransfer(manager, amount0);
282:         }
283: 
284:         if (amount1 > 0) {
285:             token1.safeTransfer(manager, amount1);
286:         }
287: 
288:         emit LogWithdrawManagerBalance(amount0, amount1);
289:     }
```

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

The `setManager()` function must have only one task which is to assign the new manager. The withdraw amounts should be assigned in a mapping struct E.g. `managerBalance0[manager] += fee` and the withdraw function should be called only by the manager. So the managers can be assigned via the `setManager()` function and each manager can claim their assigned rewards.
