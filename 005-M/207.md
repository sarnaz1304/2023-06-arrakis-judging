# setManager can be DOS

## Summary
If token0 or token1 is USDC and the manager is added to the blacklist, the setManager function can fail when the owner wants to change the manager
## Vulnerability Detail

    function setManager(address manager_) external onlyOwner { 
    _withdrawManagerBalance();//@audit-issue manager can added to black list 
    manager = manager_; emit LogSetManager(manager_); 
    }

As you can see, the issue is that the function calls 

    _withdrawManagerBalance

 before changing the manager.

This function tries to transfer the values of managerBalance0 and managerBalance1 to the manager address

     function _withdrawManagerBalance() internal {
        uint256 amount0 = managerBalance0;
        uint256 amount1 = managerBalance1;

        managerBalance0 = 0;
        managerBalance1 = 0;

        if (amount0 > 0) {
            token0.safeTransfer(manager, amount0);
        }

        if (amount1 > 0) {
            token1.safeTransfer(manager, amount1);
        }

        emit LogWithdrawManagerBalance(amount0, amount1);
    }

Therefore, if either of the two tokens is USDC and the address is on the blacklist, this makes it impossible to change the manager

## Recommendation
could make the old manager withdraw the balances in another function
