# Chainlink oracles staleness check can cause regular lengthy denials of service

## Summary
Querying Chainlink prices via `ChainLinkOraclePivot` can cause regular lengthy denials of service due to a reverting price staleness check.
## Vulnerability Detail
[ChainLinkOraclePivot](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-manager-templates/contracts/oracles/ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol#L11) is designed to query two Chainlink oracles when fetching a price of a token. The contract allows to configure only one price freshness duration (the `outdated` state variable). However, different Chainlink price feeds have different heartbeat periods: for example, the [ETH/USD feed](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd) is updated every 3600 seconds, but the [LINK/ETH feed](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-eth/link-eth) is updated every 21600 seconds. If, for example, the `outdated` state variable is set to 3600 seconds, then querying a LINK/ETH price will be constantly failing after 3600 seconds have passed since the LINK/ETH feed has been updated and until it's updated again (in this case, the DoS will continue for 18000 seconds (5 hours) after every 3600 seconds (1 hour)). Rebalancing of vaults won't be possible during this period since rebalancing [requires a fresh asset price fetched from Chainlink](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-manager-templates/contracts/SimpleManager.sol#L189-L194).
## Impact
Rebalancing can be regularly blocked for multiple hours (23 hours out of 24 hours, in the worst case), not allowing operators to optimize the distribution of user funds in Uniswap pools.
## Code Snippet
1. In `ChainLinkOraclePivot._getLatestRoundData`, the `outdated` state variable is used to check the staleness of both feeds:

[ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol#L264](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-manager-templates/contracts/oracles/ChainLinkOraclePivot.sol#L264)

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider using two state variables to set the freshness periods of each Chainlink feed (e.g. `outdatedA` and `outdatedB`). Each of the state variables needs to be set to the heartbeat period of the respective feed.
Notice that `outdated` cannot be set to the longer of the two periods because it'll introduce another issue: the contract will fail to catch stale prices in the feed with the shorter heartbeat period (e.g. if, in the above example, `outdated` is set to 21600, the ETH/USD feed will be allowed to report stale prices).
