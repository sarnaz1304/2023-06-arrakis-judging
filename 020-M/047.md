# ChainLinkOraclePivot uses the same heartbeat for both underlying feeds

## Summary
ChainLinkOraclePivot uses the same heartbeat for both feeds which is highly dangerous

## Vulnerability Detail
ChainLinkOraclePivot uses the same heartbeat for both feeds when checking if the data feed is fresh. 
A Chainlink oracle may have very different heartbeats: 
USDC/USD has 24h while most other oracles have 1h

If one were to pair USDC/USD oracle with a faster one, and take the value of the faster one as heartbeat, the pivot would be considered stale most of the time. Alternatively, in the same pairing if one were to choose the slower one (24h), one would consume stale data on the faster oracle.

## Impact
Either pivot stuck because considered stale most of the time, or stale data consumed from a faster oracle

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use two different variables to evaluate freshness of the combination of chainlink oracles
