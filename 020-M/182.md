# ChainLinkOraclePivot uses the same heartbeat for both feeds which leads to stale price data

## Summary

ChainLinkOraclePivot uses the same heartbeat for both feeds when checking if the data feed is fresh. The issue with this is that oracles (such as [USDC](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/usdc-usd) or [ETH](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd)) oracle can have much different heartbeats. Since they use the same heartbeat the heartbeat needs to be slower of the two or else the contract would be nonfunctional most of the time. The issue is that it would allow the consumption of potentially very stale data from the feed with the lower heartbeat.

This forces one of two issues:
    
    1) Stale data can be consumed from the faster oracle
    2) Valid data from the slower oracle will trigger a revert when the data is still fresh

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary

## Impact

When heartbeats are mismatched either stale data is consumed or the contract will be nearly non-functional

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Each of the two pricefeeds should have their own `outdated` value
