# `ArrakisV2Router::addLiquidity` can transfer amounts higher than the maximum specified by the user

## Summary

`ArrakisV2Router::addLiquidity` can transfer amounts higher than the maximum specified by the user

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user calls `ArrakisV2Router::addLiquidity`, they specify `amount0Max` and `amount1Max` as part of the parameters.
These values are however not checked and enforced before tokens are transfered from the user. Only the minimum amounts are enforced:

```solidity
        require(
            amount0 >= params_.amount0Min &&
                amount1 >= params_.amount1Min &&
                sharesReceived >= params_.amountSharesMin,
            "below min amounts"
        );
```

In the case where `getMintAmounts` returns higher values, the user would have a higher amount of tokens transfered from them.

```solidity
        (amount0, amount1, sharesReceived) = resolver.getMintAmounts(
            IArrakisV2(params_.vault),
            params_.amount0Max,
            params_.amount1Max
        );
```
This is possible because `getMintAmounts` and `totalUnderlyingForMint` round up the amounts required. It is also possible in times of high price volatility.

## Impact

Users will have more amounts transfered from them than they intended.

## Recommendation

Enforce a check to ensure the amounts returned by `getMintAmounts` are less than the maximum amounts specified by the user.
