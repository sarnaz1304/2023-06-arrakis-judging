# XO-  a negative value subtract from the global `fee` growth in the `computeFeesEarned` function, resulting in an incorrect value for the `fee` growth inside the range.

## Summary
- The `_computeFeesEarned` function in the contract could subtract a negative value from the global fee growth, which would result in an incorrect value for the fee growth inside the range.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
uint256 feeGrowthInside = computeFees_.feeGrowthGlobal -
                feeGrowthBelow -
                feeGrowthAbove;

```
-The fee growth inside the range by subtracting the fee growth below the range and the fee growth above the range from the global fee growth. However, if the fee growth below the range is greater than the global fee growth, then this line of code will subtract a negative value from the global fee growth, which will result in an incorrect value for the fee growth inside the range.
```solidity
function _computeFeesEarned(ComputeFeesPayload memory computeFees_)
        private
        pure
        returns (uint256 fee)
    {
        unchecked {
            // calculate fee growth below
            uint256 feeGrowthBelow;
            if (computeFees_.tick >= computeFees_.lowerTick) {
                feeGrowthBelow = computeFees_.feeGrowthOutsideLower;
            } else {
                feeGrowthBelow =
                    computeFees_.feeGrowthGlobal -
                    computeFees_.feeGrowthOutsideLower;
            }

            // calculate fee growth above
            uint256 feeGrowthAbove;
            if (computeFees_.tick < computeFees_.upperTick) {
                feeGrowthAbove = computeFees_.feeGrowthOutsideUpper;
            } else {
                feeGrowthAbove =
                    computeFees_.feeGrowthGlobal -
                    computeFees_.feeGrowthOutsideUpper;
            }

            uint256 feeGrowthInside = computeFees_.feeGrowthGlobal -
                feeGrowthBelow -
                feeGrowthAbove;
            fee = FullMath.mulDiv(
                computeFees_.liquidity,
                feeGrowthInside - computeFees_.feeGrowthInsideLast,
                0x100000000000000000000000000000000
            );
        }
    }
}
```
## Impact
- The incorrect value for the fee growth inside the range could be used to calculate the amount of fees that are earned by the contract. If the amount of fees that are earned is incorrect, then the contract could lose funds.

## Recommendation
```solidity
uint256 feeGrowthInside = max(
    computeFees_.feeGrowthGlobal - feeGrowthBelow - feeGrowthAbove,
    0
);
```
-Here the `fee` growth inside the range is never negative.
