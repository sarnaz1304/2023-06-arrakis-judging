# standardRebalance() and rebalance() functions are extemely vulnerable to manipulation

## Summary
` ArrakisV2Resolver#standardRebalance ` and ` SimpleManager#rebalance ` rebalance ArrakisV2 vault's using the UniV3Pool.slot0 price.
` slot0 ` price can be manipulated with flash loans.

## Vulnerability Detail
` slot0 ` is the most recent data point and is therefore extremely easy to manipulate.
The ` slot0 ` price is calculated from the ratios of the assets. This ratio can however be manipulated by buying/selling assets in the pool.

## Impact
Price can be manipulated to cause flash loan exploits or loss of funds for the protocol and other users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use TWAP price instead of ` slot0 ` price. [Here](https://github.com/charmfinance/alpha-vaults-contracts/blob/07db2b213315eea8182427be4ea51219003b8c1a/contracts/AlphaStrategy.sol#L136-L144) is an example implementation of TWAP.
