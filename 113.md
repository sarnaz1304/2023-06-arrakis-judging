# The `rebalance` function that is used in `ArrakisV2.sol` may revert all the time in some cases

## Summary
The function `rebalance`  is used by a manager to rebalance the the amount of tokens in the contract but this function can revert 100% in some cases of some ERC20.
## Vulnerability Detail
The problem of the `rebalance` function relies in the fact that it `approve` to 0 before approving `balanceOf(address(this))` as can be seen here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L322-L323 but in the some cases ERC20 tokens revert on 0 `approve`, one big example of this is BNB on Ethereum mainnet, one of the biggest ERC20 by market cap which has Uniswap pool and is fully integrated with ChainLink, in the case of BNB the `approve` function throws if the value used is 0

so if the protocol uses BNB the rebalance function would be unusable since it will revert 100% of the time. 
## Impact
This is a medium severity issues since it happens only with some ERC20 tokens but since BNB is widely used because of it's market cap, the issue is likely to happen and this will break the functionality of the `rebalance` function.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Take special care for cases like BNB or specify before-hand that the protocol is not working completely for those cases
