# Returned Values Of `amount0` and `amount1` From `totalUnderlyingForMint()` is Incorrect.

## Summary
Logic for calculating `amount0` and `amount1` should be changed in function `totalUnderlyingForMint()` inside `Underlying.sol` Contract file

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        amount0 += FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
            mintAmount_,
            fee0After +
                IERC20(underlyingPayload_.token0).balanceOf(
                    underlyingPayload_.self
                ) -
                arrakisV2.managerBalance0(), // @audit-issue calculation is wrong
            totalSupply_
        );
        amount1 += FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
            mintAmount_,
            fee1After +
                IERC20(underlyingPayload_.token1).balanceOf(
                    underlyingPayload_.self
                ) -
                arrakisV2.managerBalance1(),
            totalSupply_
        );
```
Where `fee0After` is remaining Fee0 after substracting `ManagerCut` from Original net fee0
```solidity
fee0 = rawFee0_ - ((rawFee0_ * (managerFeeBPS_)) / 10000);
```
It has serise of problem;
. `ManagerCut` get substarcted for second time
. Addition of fee1After is incorrect.

This Should be as below

```solidity
amount0 += FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(mintAmount_, leftOver0, totalSupply_);
```
Where `leftOver0` will
```solidity
leftOver0 =  IERC20(underlyingPayload_.token0).balanceOf(underlyingPayload_.self) - arrakisV2.managerBalance0() - amount0;
```
