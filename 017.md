# Lack of Input Validation Leading to Unexpected Behavior

## Summary

The contract `Underlying.sol` does not validate the inputs to its functions. This can lead to unexpected behavior or potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `getAmountsForDelta()` does not validate its inputs and operates under the assumption that the inputs will always be correct. This can lead to unexpected behavior if an incorrect input is supplied.

## Impact

If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to faulty execution of contract functions. In the worst-case scenario, an attacker could manipulate the inputs to achieve their own goals.

## Code Snippet

In `Underlying.sol`:

```solidity
function getAmountsForDelta(
        uint160 sqrtRatioX96,
        uint160 sqrtRatioAX96,
        uint160 sqrtRatioBX96,
        int128 liquidity
    ) public pure returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {...}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Always validate function inputs. This can be done using modifiers or require statements at the beginning of functions.

## Proof Of Concept

1. Deploy the contract on a local Ethereum fork.
2. Call the `getAmountsForDelta()` function with invalid or unexpected inputs.
3. Observe the function's unexpected behavior.
