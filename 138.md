# An attacker can drain ArrakisV2Router from all of its ETH

## Summary

A missing assignment can be abused to drain the `ArrakisV2Router` from all of its ETH.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `addLiquidityPermit2` there is a missing assignment of `isToken0Weth` which will always be false:

```solidity
//@audit isToken0Weth is always false, as it is never assigned
bool isToken0Weth;
_permit2Add(params_, amount0, amount1, token0, token1);

_addLiquidity(
    params_.addData.vault,
    amount0,
    amount1,
    sharesReceived,
    params_.addData.gauge,
    params_.addData.receiver,
    token0,
    token1
);

if (msg.value > 0) {
    if (isToken0Weth && msg.value > amount0) {
        payable(msg.sender).sendValue(msg.value - amount0);
    } else if (!isToken0Weth && msg.value > amount1) {
        payable(msg.sender).sendValue(msg.value - amount1);
    }
}
```

The [last snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L292-L298) of logic is meant to refund the excess ETH, but it can be abused due to this bug. The attack would work in the following way:

1. Attacker creates or uses a vault with a `WETH - TOKEN` pair (can be any token with an unbalanced swap ratio, e.g. `5 ETH <-> 1 TOKEN`)

2. Attacker calls `addLiquidityPermit2` with `token0 = WETH`, `token1 = TOKEN`, `msg.value = 5e18` and `amount0Max = 5e18`

3. The Router swaps `5 WETH` for `1 TOKEN` through the vault

4. The following line will always execute as `isToken0Weth` is always false:

```solidity
else if (!isToken0Weth && msg.value > amount1) {
    payable(msg.sender).sendValue(msg.value - amount1);
}
```

5. The attacker swapped `5 ETH` for `1 TOKEN`, plus they are "refunded" by `4 ETH`, so, in the end, they have `4 ETH` plus `1 TOKEN`, but they shouldn't have got any excess `ETH`.

## Impact

High as it's possible to drain the router from all of its ETH, and anyone can create a vault with any pair.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the missing logic:

```diff
  bool isToken0Weth;
+ if (msg.value > 0) {
+     isToken0Weth = _wrapETH(
+         params_.addData.amount0Max,
+         params_.addData.amount1Max,
+         false,
+         token0,
+         token1
+     );
+ }
```
