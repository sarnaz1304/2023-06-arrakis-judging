# Vault owner if sets Manager with wrong address, it will lead to loss of manager funds.

## Summary
ArrakisV2 exposes set Manager function which can be called by Owner only. The set manager function does not check for zero address and hence by mistake, the owner of the vault can be set to zero address/wrong address. 

The owner has the ability to reset the manager to a correct address, but in the set Manager function, the manager funds collected so far are transferred to current manager's address before assigning the new address.

Due to this transfer of funds before updating the manager address, incase an incorrect address was set as manager, the funds collected until that point will be transfer to that address and there is no way to save that loss. 

If Owner wants to correct the address, even in that case, funds collected until that point are going to be lost for the manager who manages the vault.

## Vulnerability Detail
The implementation of set Manager binds the admin and operation functionality together. If the address was incorrectly set, the current implementation does not give an opportunity for the Owner to correct the address of the manager with out losing the funds collected so far.

This is primarily due to binding of setting and withdrawing functionalities in the set Manager function. 

## Impact
Loss of Manager funds as they will be transferred to wrong address before the correction in manager address can be made.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L209-L213

```solidity
   // @audit : before the new manager can be set, the existing funds are transferred to the current manager.
  //  incase the manager address was set to wrong address, the funds collected so far will be lost. 
    function setManager(address manager_) external onlyOwner { // no check for validating @audit
        _withdrawManagerBalance();
        manager = manager_;
        emit LogSetManager(manager_);
    }
```

```solidity
    function _withdrawManagerBalance() internal {
        uint256 amount0 = managerBalance0;
        uint256 amount1 = managerBalance1;

        managerBalance0 = 0;
        managerBalance1 = 0;

        if (amount0 > 0) {
            token0.safeTransfer(manager, amount0);
        }

        if (amount1 > 0) {
            token1.safeTransfer(manager, amount1);
        }

        emit LogWithdrawManagerBalance(amount0, amount1);
    }
```
## Tool used
Tested using the test scripts:

```javascript
Using the test script, was able to set the address to 0x0 or any other address for that matter and then calling setManager on the vault
will lead to loss of funds as the current balance in both the token0 and token1 are transferred to the old address.

expect(await vaultV2.manager()).to.be.eq(managerAddr);
await expect(vaultV2.setManager("0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000")).to.not.be.reverted;
expect(await vaultV2.manager()).to.be.eq("0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000");
```
Manual Review

## Recommendation
a) remove the _withdrawManagerBalance() call with in the setManager function. 
b) add a new state variable to hold the address of newManager.
c) In the setManager, the owner populates the newManager with the new address
d) Contract to expose a new function, claimManager()
```solidity   
   function clainManager() external {
      require(newManager!=address(0x0),"No New manager Nominated");
      require(msg.sender==newManager),"You are not the new Nominated Manager");
      _withdrawManagerBalance();
      manager = newManager;
      newManager=address(0x0);
      emit LogSetManager(manager_);
   }  
  ```

With this approach, the possibility to assigning an incorrect address will be minimised and hence prevent loss of funds for the manager.
