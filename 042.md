# `rebalancing` in `SimpleManager.sol` will revert if the pool price is far enough below the oracle price

## Summary
When rebalancing, the `expectedMinReturn` is checked against the oracle. Even if this check passes, the swap can fail if the `poolprice` is below the oracle price

## Vulnerability Detail
When a manager wants to rebalance a vault he calls `rebalance()` in `SimpleManager.sol`. This function first checks if the price of the pool is within a `maxDeviation` of the oracle price. Then it checks if the `expectedMinReturn` is within the determined `maxSlipage`. For this check the oracle price is used. The check can succeed but if the `pool price` is far enough below the `oracle price` the swap will fail and the whole function will revert.

Example:

`maxDeviation` = 2%, `maxSlippage` = 1% (Date from the test files)

Letâ€™s assume we want to swap 1 eth to a minimum of 990 USDT. The oracle price is 1000 USD. With a `maxDeviation` of 2% the pool price can be as low as 980 USD for the deviation check to succeed. Now the `maxSlippage` is checked against the oracle price and succeeds since `maxSlippage` of 1% based on the oracle price of 1000 USD results in the return of 990 USDT. But since the pool price is already at 980 USDT there is now way that swapping 1 Eth in the pool results in getting 990 USDT. The function should revert here already but continues to execute until the swap fails.  


## Impact
Rebalancing is wasting unnecessary gas because `expectedMinReturn` is only checked against the oracle price and not agaist the pool price. If the rebalancing is spanning over a lot of ranges and only fails at the last one the gas cost can be really high and since the manager is paying the gas this will reduce his overall profit from managing the vault.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `maxSlippage` should also be checked against the `pool price` to ensure that the swap can be successfull
