# Anyone who calls initManagement  function can set any value for the manager's fee, including setting it to 0

## Summary
In the initManagement function of the SimpleManager contract, the manager's fee (managerFeeBPS) is set directly in the vaults mapping without performing any validation or range checks on the provided value. This means that anyone who calls this function can set any value for the manager's fee, including setting it to 0
## Vulnerability Detail
in the initManagement function, the managerFeeBPS value provided in the params struct is directly assigned to the managerFeeBPS field of the VaultInfo struct. There are no validation or range checks performed on the provided managerFeeBPS value.
Without proper validation or range checks, the contract allows setting the manager's fee to any value, including 0, which can be exploited by attackers to exploit the system and potentially cause financial harm. Also  by setting the fee to 0, the attacker can exploit the system and benefit from the management services without paying any fees, leading to a loss in revenue for the vault
## Impact
An attacker who sets the fee to 0 can manage the vault without incurring any fees. This will cause financial loss to the vault or its investors because the manager's fee is an important mechanism for generating revenue and incentivizing the manager to make profitable decisions for the vault.

Manual Review
## Recommendation
Include a check to ensure that the managerFeeBPS provided is greater than 0 and within the acceptable range. If the provided value is outside this range, the transaction will revert with an "Invalid fee" error message.

Or add a range check . This ensures that the fee value is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10000 (which represents 100% in basis points). Adjust the upper limit of the range (10000) based on your specific requirements.
