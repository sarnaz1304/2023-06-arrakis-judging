# Liqudity burning slippage protection in rebalance process could be bypassed

## Summary

Liqudity burning slippage checkes exsit in `SimpleManager::rebalance` and `ArrakisV2::rebalance`. These checks could be bypassed, thereby allowing sandwich attacks on rebalance.

## Vulnerability Detail

Inside `SimpleManager::rebalance`, the `_checkDeviation` function checks within a for loop to ensure that every `rebalanceParams_.mints` pool is not price-manipulated. However, the check does not include the `rebalanceParams_.burns` pools. If `rebalanceParams_.burns` and `rebalanceParams_.mints` are not equal, some of the `rebalanceParams_.burns` pools could be missed by the check.

Inside `ArrakisV2::rebalance`, the liquidities in `rebalanceParams_.burns` pools are burned. The slippage checks are applied to the aggregated results. A sandwich attacker can bypass these checks by pushing up the price of one pool and reducing the price of another. This will counteract the two slippage effects and correct the final aggregated results.

```solidity
    aggregator.burn0 += withdraw.burn0;
    aggregator.burn1 += withdraw.burn1;

    aggregator.fee0 += withdraw.fee0;
    aggregator.fee1 += withdraw.fee1;
}

require(aggregator.burn0 >= rebalanceParams_.minBurn0, "B0");
require(aggregator.burn1 >= rebalanceParams_.minBurn1, "B1");
```

These are all the slippage checkes involved in the liquidity burning process. For a successful sandwich attack on the liquidity burning in the rebalance process, `rebalanceParams_.burns` needs to have at least two pools that do not exist in `rebalanceParams_.mints`. Some non-malicious strategies may satisfy this or a malicious keeper bot can post such rebalance payload.

## Impact

Sandwich attack on the liquidity burning in the rebalance process if the above condition is met.

## Recommendation

Apply `_checkDeviation` check not only to mint pools but also to burn pools.
