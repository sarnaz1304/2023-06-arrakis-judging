# OOG for unbound loop for `_ranges` prevents users to deposit additional funds in any way

## Summary
If the length of the array `_ranges` in `ArrakisV2.sol` gets to long the function ‘totalUnderlyingForMint’ in `ArrakisV2Resolver.sol` will run out of gas. This function is used by all functions used for depositing funds and there for will prevent the user to deposit any additional funds to the vault.


## Vulnerability Detail
If a user wants to deposit assets into a vault, he can call the functions `mint` in `ArrakisV2.sol` or `addLiquidity`, `addLiquidityPermit2` or `swapAndAddLiquidity` in `ArrakisV2Rounter.sol`. All those functions call ‘totalUnderlyingForMint’ in `ArrakisV2Resolver.sol` which iterates over the array of `_ranges` and proportionally mints the liquidity provided by the user into each `range` the vault is invested in. If the number of ranges is to big, the function mentioned above will run out of gas and the user will not be able to deposit any additional assets in any way.  

## Impact
If users cannot deposit their assets into a vault at any time, he might move his assets to another project since he cannot be sure that he will be able to withdraw his assets when he wants when not even depositing is working properly.

## Recommendation

Limit the number of ranges a vault can enter when rebalancing to prevent this issue
