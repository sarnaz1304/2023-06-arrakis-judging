# ```managerFeeBps``` is not checked when rebalancing in ```SimpleManager.sol```

## Summary

A lack of checks in the ```rebalance``` function in ```SimpleManager.sol``` could allow a vault owner to cheat a manager out of their fee by switching to a different manager, setthing the managerFeeBps to 0 and switching back again before the manager executes the rebalance.

## Vulnerability Detail

When ```rebalance``` is called in ```SimpleManager.sol```, it only checks that the vault's manager is the same as address(this) and does not check that the ```managerFeeBps``` stored in the manager contract is the same as the ```managerFeeBps``` of the vault. By frontrunning a call to the ```rebalance``` function, the vault owner could set the vault's manager to a contract they control to set the manager fee to 0 in the vault. The vault owner can then change the manager back to the original SimpleManager contract to benefit from its strategy. 

During the rebalance on the vault contract's side, the ```_applyFees``` function is called but does not accrue fees for the manager since the fee was set to 0 in the vault.

```solidity
    function _applyFees(uint256 fee0_, uint256 fee1_) internal {
        uint16 mManagerFeeBPS = managerFeeBPS;
        managerBalance0 += (fee0_ * mManagerFeeBPS) / hundredPercent;
        managerBalance1 += (fee1_ * mManagerFeeBPS) / hundredPercent;
    }
```

## Impact

A vault owner could cheat an unaware manager out of their fee.

## Recommendation

To prevent a malicious vault owner from benifitng from a manager's strategy without paying fees, consider adding a check in the ```rebalance``` function of ```SimpleManager.sol``` that reverts when the vault's managerFeeBps is not equal to the managerFeeBps stored in the manager contract. Alternatively, the vault could use the managerFeeBps of the current manager instead of its own stored value in the ```_applyFees``` function of ```ArrakisV2.sol```.
