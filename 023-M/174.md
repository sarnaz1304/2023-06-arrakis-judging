# changing `managerFeeBPS` can cause unfair shares in pool

## Summary
Changing `managerFeeBPS` will cause positions entered at the previous fee to become unfair. Which direction depends on which direction the `managerFee` is changed.

## Vulnerability Detail
When minting a new position in `ArrakisV2` and there already are stakes the amount of tokens to pay for a certain share is determined by using the current balance:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L68-L78
```solidity
File: v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol

68:            (amount0, amount1) = UnderlyingHelper.totalUnderlyingForMint(
69:                UnderlyingPayload({
70:                    ranges: _ranges,
71:                    factory: factory,
72:                    token0: address(token0),
73:                    token1: address(token1),
74:                    self: me
75:                }),
76:                mintAmount_,
77:                ts
78:            );
```

And in `totalUnderlyingForMint` the share amount of each range is added together with the fees accumulated:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol#L43-L60
```solidity
File: v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol

43:                (
44:                    uint256 a0,
45:                    uint256 a1,
46:                    uint256 f0,
47:                    uint256 f1
48:                ) = underlyingMint(
49:                        RangeData({
50:                            self: underlyingPayload_.self,
51:                            range: underlyingPayload_.ranges[i],
52:                            pool: pool
53:                        }),
54:                        mintAmount_,
55:                        totalSupply_
56:                    );
57:                amount0 += a0;
58:                amount1 += a1;
59:                fee0 += f0;
60:                fee1 += f1;
```

Then trading fees + free tokens in the pool - managerBalance is calculated, adding the amount the user needs to pay to buy in to a share of these:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol#L66-L89
```solidity
 66:        (uint256 fee0After, uint256 fee1After) = subtractAdminFees(
 67:            fee0,
 68:            fee1,
 69:            arrakisV2.managerFeeBPS()
 70:        );
 71:
 72:        amount0 += FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
 73:            mintAmount_,
 74:            fee0After +
 75:                IERC20(underlyingPayload_.token0).balanceOf(
 76:                    underlyingPayload_.self
 77:                ) -
 78:                arrakisV2.managerBalance0(),
 79:            totalSupply_
 80:        );
		   ... // same but for token1

...

345:    function subtractAdminFees(
346:        uint256 rawFee0_,
347:        uint256 rawFee1_,
348:        uint16 managerFeeBPS_
349:    ) public pure returns (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) {
350:        fee0 = rawFee0_ - ((rawFee0_ * (managerFeeBPS_)) / 10000);
351:        fee1 = rawFee1_ - ((rawFee1_ * (managerFeeBPS_)) / 10000);
352:    }
```

The issue is if `managerFeeBPS` is changed this calculation will give a unfair share. Imagine an extreme scenario where there are just 10 `token0`, but they have accumulated 100 `token0` in fees (disregard `token1` for now). The managerFee is 0%. current `totalSupply` is also 10.

Ada buys an equal share, `mintAmount=10`. She will need to pay 110 `token0` for this. As during the calculation 0% of the fees were admin fees.

Then, the manager changes the fee to 100%. If Ada now burns her position she will only get the 60 `token0` ((10 + 110)/2) as all of the 100 tokens gained from fees are suddenly `managerFee`.

Compare this to if Ada would have bought her equal shares just after the manager fee was changed, then she would just have had to pay 10 `token0` to buy the equal share.

This of course an extreme scenario but it highlights the issue. It will also be mitigated during `rebalance` (given that positions are burnt) as that accumulates the manager fees.

## Impact
If the managerFee is changed, vault users who joined before the managerFee change will get an unfair share. How unfair depends on how much swap fees are accumulated and how long it has been since a `burn` (either through `rebalance` or "regular" `burn`.

## Code Snippet

## Recommendation
Consider collecting fees and accumulating `managerFee` after each `mint`. Since `tokensOwed` in the pool is updated for each position change (`mint`/`burn`) this will properly accumulate the `managerFee`.
