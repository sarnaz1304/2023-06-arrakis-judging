# Centralization risk for trusted owners

## Summary
Having a single Externally Owned Account (EOA) as the sole owner represents a significant centralization and single point of failure.

## Vulnerability Detail
Contracts have owners that have privileged rights to perform admin tasks based on modifier onlyOwner. These owners need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds. 

## Impact

A private key could be stolen, access to a key may lost by accident, an owner could act in a malicious manner. In every scenario considered there exists a potential risk of financial loss for project.

## Recommendation
onlyOwner functions that change critical parameters should emit events and have time-locks.
Events allow capturing the changed parameters so that off-chain tools/interfaces can register such changes with timelocks that allow users to react by evaluating the changes. Timelock function also assist users in terms of considering if they would like to engage/exit based on how they perceive the changes as affecting the trustworthiness of the protocol or profitability of the implemented financial services.
Allow only multi-signature wallets to call these functions to reduce the likelihood of an attack or unintentional loss.
