# lack of trust verification in `SimpleManager::initManagement`

## Summary
Untrusted vaults can be added to `SimpleManager` and then cannot be removed.

## Vulnerability Detail
ArrakisV2 vaults cannot be trusted on their own (anyone can create one and be owner). When adding a vault to be managed by `SimpleManager` a simple check that [the `manager` or the vault is the `SimpleManager` contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-manager-templates/contracts/SimpleManager.sol#L95) is done.

However, nothing checks that this vault can be trusted. There is no check that the `owner` is renounced. Hence the `owner` could simply change `manager` when they want to collect fees (and change it back for `rebalance` again).

Nor is there any check that the `pools` in the vault are actual uniswap pools (a malicious pool could steal all the funds in the contract).

Also if a faulty vault is added, there's no way to remove it.

## Impact
Untrusted vaults can be added to `SimpleManager`. Granted, these checks could all be done off-chain but having it in code will increase trust by users.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider verifying that the `owner` is `address(1)` and that the `pools` in the contract are actually created by uniswap factory.

Also consider to add a way to remove vaults, that way inactive vaults or accidentally added can be removed. Also, vault parameters can be updated if needed (be re-adding the vault).
