# Arrakis contract susceptible to inflation attack

## Summary

Arrakis contract can be attacked with inflation attack.

## Vulnerability Detail

The inflation attack is a common attack vector present in ERC4626 and other types of vault contracts. The Arrakis contract is also susceptible to this attack.

During the `mint` process, the contract checks if the `totalSupply()` of the contract is zero. If non-zero, the underlying helper function is used to calculate how many tokens should be charged for a mint.

The function `totalUnderlyingForMint` calculates how many tokens need to be accepted to mint a certain number of share tokens. This function loops over different range values and calculates the amounts of underlying present as liquidity. The issue is that uniswap allows minting liquidity in another contract's address. Thus liquidity can be "donated" to carry out a DOS attack.

Function `getAmountsForDelta` calculates the actual amount of proportional liquidity the user must provide. This function is called with the proportionally scaled value of liquidity as shown below.

The last parameter is the scaled value, calculated by `liquidity * mintAmount / totalSupply`. Since `totalSupply` is in the denominator, it can be manipulated for small values. If the contract is donated liquidity, the value of the `liquidity` parameter can eb set arbitrarily high. If the actual `totalSupply` is low, of the order of 10 wei, then the smallest amount of mint (1 wei) will require ~10% of the liquidity to be submitted. Thus the minimum amount of tokens that can be fed to the contract can be set to a high value, DOSing users who want to deposit small amounts.

## Impact

DOS of users. Contract setting a high minimum deposit value.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol#L237-L250

Consider the scenario where the contract is freshly deployed. `init0` and `init1` are both set to `0.5e17`, allowing for equal ratios of token0 and token1.

1. Attacker calls `mint(2,address)`. The attacker is thus minted 2 wei of LP token. Since the ratio is the same, the attacker is charged 1 wei of token0 and 1 wei of token1 as liquidity.
2. Attacker deposits liquidity worth 1e18 token0 and 1e18 token1 in the pool externally and sets the Arrakis contract as receiver. Thus the Arrakis contract now has liquidity of 1e18 for each token, and totalSupply of 2 wei.
3. Other users come to deposit more tokens. The minimum amount to be minted is 1 wei, and thus calls `mint(1,address)`. Since the totalSupply is 2 and liquidity present is 1e18, the amount calculated is `1e18 * 1 / 2 = 5e17`. Thus the user must deposit a minimum of 0.5 ETH of tokens to interact with the contract.
4. The attacker can choose to donate any number of tokens. If they donate 10000 USDC, then the minimum deposit amount will be set to 5000USDC, DOSing a lot of users.

Since the attack impacts functionality of the contract but only in the early stages, this is classified as a medium severity issue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Burn the initial 100 wei of LP tokens minted from the Arrakis contract. This will ensure that the ratios cannot be skewed enough to DOS other users.
