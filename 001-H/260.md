# ## User will be costed more amount of `token0` and `token1` while minting same `mintAmount`.

## Summary
User will be costed more amount of `token0` and `token1` while minting same `mintAmount`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function [ArrakisV2.sol/withdrawManagerBalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L417) is callable by anyone. This function controls the payment of manager, and `managerBalance0`and `managerBalance1`. Now, these two state variables are used in the calculation of `amount0` and `amount1` which are deducted from user.

## Impact
1. Any mint transaction can be front-runned with the `withdrawManagerBalance()` function which will cause `managerBalance0` and `managerBalance1` to decrease and hence will affect the tokens deducted from the user.
2. Also the block validator can rearrange the mint transactions so that their transaction will come just before the `withdrawManagerBalance()` and after every other mint transaction so that their transaction experience highest value of `managerBalance` and will then be costing them the lowest amount of tokens.
3. This minting is basically oriented towards the block validators who can rearrange the transactions for their profit.

## Code Snippet
The mint function calls `Underlying.sol/totalUnderlyingForMint()` which uses `managerBalance0` and `managerBalance1`
```solidity
amount0 += FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
            mintAmount_,
            fee0After +
                IERC20(underlyingPayload_.token0).balanceOf(
                    underlyingPayload_.self
                ) -
                arrakisV2.managerBalance0(),
            totalSupply_
        );
        amount1 += FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(
            mintAmount_,
            fee1After +
                IERC20(underlyingPayload_.token1).balanceOf(
                    underlyingPayload_.self
                ) -
                arrakisV2.managerBalance1(),
            totalSupply_
        );
```
the formula states that decrease in the value of manager balance will increase `amount0` and `amount1`. Which will be paid by the user minting.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The function of [ArrakisV2.sol/withdrawManagerBalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L417) should not be called by anyone but by the governance only and at regular basis.
