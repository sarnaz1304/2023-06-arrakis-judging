# any tokens in `ArrakisV2Router` can be claimed using false permit

## Summary
Arrakis V2 uses `Permit2` by uniswap to transfer tokens. However the tokens transferred by `Permit2` are never checked to be the same as `token0`/`1`.

## Vulnerability Detail
When using `Permit2` to transfer tokens via the Router, this call is made:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L605-L621
```solidity
File: v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol

605:            require(params_.permit.permitted.length == 2, "length mismatch");
606:            SignatureTransferDetails[]
607:                memory transfers = new SignatureTransferDetails[](2);
608:            transfers[0] = SignatureTransferDetails({
609:                to: address(this),
610:                requestedAmount: amount0_
611:            });
612:            transfers[1] = SignatureTransferDetails({
613:                to: address(this),
614:                requestedAmount: amount1_
615:            });
616:            permit2.permitTransferFrom(
617:                params_.permit,
618:                transfers,
619:                msg.sender,
620:                params_.signature
621:            );
```

The issue here is that which token is used is passed in `params_.permit` hence a user could send whatever ERC20 compliant token there that will be transferred to the router.

Then when adding liquidity the router assumes that `token0`/`1` has been transferred:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L399-L448
```solidity

399:    function _addLiquidity(
            ...
409:    ) internal {
410:        token0_.safeIncreaseAllowance(vault_, amount0In_);
411:        token1_.safeIncreaseAllowance(vault_, amount1In_);
412:
			...
431:
432:        uint256 balance0 = token0_.balanceOf(address(this));
433:        uint256 balance1 = token1_.balanceOf(address(this));
434:        if (gauge_ == address(0)) {
435:            IArrakisV2(vault_).mint(mintAmount_, receiver_);
436:        } else {
                ...
442:        }
443:
444:
445:        require(
446:            balance0 - amount0In_ == token0_.balanceOf(address(this)),
447:            "deposit0"
448:        );
449:        require(
450:            balance1 - amount1In_ == token1_.balanceOf(address(this)),
451:            "deposit1"
452:        );
453:    }
```

If there are `token0`/`1` in the router contract, these can be minted on the callers behalf in the Arrakis vault.

## Impact
An attacker can claim any `token0`/`1` in `ArrakisV2Router`. Since there is no fair way for tokens to end up in Router (only possible by mistake or badly configured vault) hence just medium. Mainly because it is easy to verify that the tokens in the `permit` are the same as in the vault.

See [any tokens in `ArrakisV2Router` can be claimed using `removeLiquidity`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis-0ximmeas/issues/3) for more discussion about how to deal with tokens accidentally ending up in the router.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Verify that tokens used in the permit are the same as `token0`/`1`
