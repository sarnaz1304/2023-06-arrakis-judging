# safeApprove can not use to reset allowance

## Summary

SafeApprove can be called only when allowance is assured to be 0. But if allowance is 0, no further action is required.   

## Vulnerability Detail

Take RouterSwapExecutor swap for example, ArrakisV2 rebalance is same:

```

```shell
yarn test ./test/ArrakisV2RouterUsdcWeth.test.ts --grep 32
```

If the data is modified to mismatch, some tokens remain unspent, and an error occurs when calling safeApprove.
This is not expected, because there is a subsequent refund logic in the ArrakisV2Router contract, that is, if the user enters extra tokens, it should be returned, rather than the transaction directly revert.   
```solidity
        if (amount0Use > amount0 && (msg.value == 0 || !isToken0Weth)) {
            token0_.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount0Use - amount0);
        }
        if (amount1Use > amount1 && (msg.value == 0 || isToken0Weth)) {
            token1_.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount1Use - amount1);
        }
```

## Impact

If the user enters a mismatched amount, safeApprove will revert. Generally, the user calling the router does not enter the exact swap amount, ArrakisV2Router contract also does't check user's input, so basically this call will revert, which will greatly affect the user experience.   
By the way, safeApprove was removed in the latest version.
