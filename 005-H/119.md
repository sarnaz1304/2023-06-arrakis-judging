# ETH can be stolen from router by specifying a malicious vault in `ArrakisV2Router::removeLiquidity`

## Summary

ETH can be stolen from router by specifying a malicious vault in `ArrakisV2Router::removeLiquidity`

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user calls `ArrakisV2Router::removeLiquidity`, they specify the address of the vault as part of the parameters. They could therefore specify a custom vault they control that is tied to a worthless vault token. This worthless token is what would be transfered to the router.

```solidity
            IERC20(params_.vault).safeTransferFrom(
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
                params_.burnAmount
            );
```
`ArrakisV2Router::_removeLiquidity` would then be called and since the user controls the custom vault, they can choose what values to return i.e `amount0` and `amount1`.

```solidity
        if (removeData_.receiveETH) {
            (amount0, amount1) = IArrakisV2(removeData_.vault).burn(
                removeData_.burnAmount,
                address(this)
            );
```

If they had set the parameters to the option of receiving ETH, the router would transfer to them ETH that it holds:

```solidity
        if (removeData_.receiveETH) {
            _receiveETH(
                IArrakisV2(removeData_.vault),
                amount0,
                amount1,
                removeData_.receiver
            );
```

```solidity
    function _receiveETH(
        IArrakisV2 vault_,
        uint256 amount0_,
        uint256 amount1_,
        address payable receiver_
    ) internal {
        IERC20 token0 = vault_.token0();
        IERC20 token1 = vault_.token1();
        bool wethToken0 = _isToken0Weth(address(token0), address(token1));
        if (wethToken0) {
            if (amount0_ > 0) {
                weth.withdraw(amount0_);
                receiver_.sendValue(amount0_);
            }
            if (amount1_ > 0) {
                token1.safeTransfer(receiver_, amount1_);
            }
        } else {
            if (amount1_ > 0) {
                weth.withdraw(amount1_);
                receiver_.sendValue(amount1_);
            }
            if (amount0_ > 0) {
                token0.safeTransfer(receiver_, amount0_);
            }
        }
    }
```

The user would therefore receive free ETH in exchange for transfering worthless tokens to the router.

## Impact

Loss of ETH from the router.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a whitelist of vaults that are legitimate on the router to prevent users from specifying malicious vaults during removal of liquidity.
