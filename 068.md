# XO-`Invalid` fee  in `_addPools` making Malicious pool created

## Summary
- the vulnerability caused by the `_addPools` function, which allows an attacker to create a pool with an invalid fee tier. This could allow the attacker to drain funds from the pool or mint illegitimate LP tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function _addPools(
        uint24[] calldata feeTiers_,
        address token0Addr_,
        address token1Addr_
    ) internal {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < feeTiers_.length; i++) {
            address pool = factory.getPool(
                token0Addr_,
                token1Addr_,
                feeTiers_[i]
            );

            require(pool != address(0), "ZA");
            require(!_pools.contains(pool), "P");

            // explicit.
            _pools.add(pool);
        }
    }
```
- The `feeTiers_[i]` variable is an array of `uint24` values, and the `factory.getPool` function only accepts fee tiers that are between `0` and  `2^24 - 1` If someone were to pass a value outside of this range to the `feeTiers_[i]` variable, the `factory.getPool` function would return an invalid pool address. if some one  use this invalid pool address to perform malicious actions, such as draining funds from the pool or minting illegitimate LP tokens.
## Impact
- if someone is able to create a pool with an invalid fee tier, they could drain funds from the pool or mint illegitimate LP tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- The `_addPools` function should be modified to check the validity of the `feeTiers_[i]` variable before calling the `factory.getPool` function
