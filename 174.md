# Doing a price deviation check when rebalancing can cause vault users to lose out on swap profits

## Summary
Doing a price deviation check when rebalancing can cause vault users to lose out on swap profits

## Vulnerability Detail
To mint new positions when rebalancing a volatility a deviation check must be passed:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-manager-templates/contracts/SimpleManager.sol#L179-L194
```solidity
File: v2-manager-templates/contracts/SimpleManager.sol

179:            uint256 sqrtPriceX96;
180:
181:            (sqrtPriceX96, , , , , , ) = pool.slot0(); // <-- spot price
182:
183:            uint256 poolPrice = FullMath.mulDiv(
184:                sqrtPriceX96 * sqrtPriceX96,
185:                10 ** token0Decimals,
186:                2 ** 192
187:            );
188:
189:            _checkDeviation(
190:                poolPrice,
191:                oraclePrice,
192:                vaultInfo.maxDeviation,
193:                token1Decimals
194:            );
```

`_checkDeviation` simply checks that the uniswap and oracle price is within a certain limit.

This will likely prevent rebalancing during periods of high market volatility since the spot price will vary a lot. The issue is that to make the market volatile a lot of trading must be going on. Hence preventing rebalancing and minting new liquidity positions at this time can greatly impact profits made by the vault.

## Impact
By preventing rebalances during volatile conditions can cause vault users to lose out on swap profits.

## Code Snippet

## Recommendation
Consider removing the check for deviation for minting as it will most likely prevent necessary position changes to maximize profit during high market volatility.
