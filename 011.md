# _whiteListRouters uses token0 and token1 but these are not initialized yet

## Summary
`__whiteListRouters` checks for each router to make sure it's not the address of either token0 or token1. However, the tokens are initialized only after calling `_whiteListRouters`.
## Vulnerability Detail
`_whiteListRouters` has a check to make sure that the provided router is not `token0` nor `token1`, since this will mess up the functionalities of the protocol. However, the check is not doing anything really since it will always pass. The tokens are only set after the function is called so in the function call it will just check if `token0` or `token1` is not `address(0)`
