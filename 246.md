# User Will Only Able To Get Portion Of Their Earning When They Withdrawing Partially

## Summary
User will lost his earning depending on his Share burning amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `burn()` When Caller burn some amount of his share then `amount0` and `amount1` calculated which are
`
amount0 = burn0 + fee_0
`
where `fee_0` = is portion of net fee, this portion is decided according to share_burned amount of caller
 
Let say if User Burn 10% of his Share then,
He will able to receive only 10% of his Share Earning(`actually its less than that also as Manager take cuts`), and rest of User's earning will lost for him.

```solidity
        uint256 leftOver0 = token0.balanceOf(address(this)) -
            managerBalance0 - 
            total.burn0;
        uint256 leftOver1 = token1.balanceOf(address(this)) -
            managerBalance1 -
            total.burn1;

        amount0 = FullMath.mulDiv(leftOver0, burnAmount_, ts);
        amount1 = FullMath.mulDiv(leftOver1, burnAmount_, ts);
```
## Impact
User will lost his earning when partially burn his shares
