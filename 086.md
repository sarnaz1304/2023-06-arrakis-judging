# Beacon implementation doesn't check the address of the Msg.sender.

## Summary
When upgrading a beacon to a new implementation ,it is required that msg.sender should be the owner  the contract.This according to the docs of openzeppelin. This is not the case with the beacon contract.
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy#UpgradeableBeacon

## Vulnerability Detail
    constructor(address implementation_, address owner_)
        UpgradeableBeacon(implementation_)
    {
        require(
            implementation_ != address(0),
            "implementation is address zero"
        );
        require(owner_ != address(0), "owner is address zero");
        _transferOwnership(owner_);
    }
}
AS we can see ,the require only checks that the owner is not is a zero address but does not check that the msg.sender is the owner.
## Impact
An attacker can implement his own contract and drain funds of the vault by impersonating the owner of the contract.

## Tool used

## Recommendation
Add a require to check that msg.sender is  the real owner of the contract.
