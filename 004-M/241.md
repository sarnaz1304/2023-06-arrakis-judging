# Router paused state can be bypassed by direct calling to ArrakisV2

## Summary

Router paused state can be bypassed by direct calling to ArrakisV2

## Vulnerability Detail

ArrakisV2Router utilize modifier `whenNotPaused` to some external function such as `addLiquidity`, `swapAndAddLiquidity`, `removeLiquidity`, `addLiquidityPermit2`, `swapAndAddLiquidityPermit2`

The `paused` state within the Arrakis protocol serves as a mechanism to halt any contract interaction, effectively disabling user access to the protocol. This pause can be triggered for various reasons, preventing users from utilizing the functionalities provided.

A pause state exist to handle emergency situations or critical issues. For instance, if a vulnerability is discovered in the contract or if there is a need to mitigate a potential exploit, the contract owner can activate the pause state. This will temporarily halt certain functions or prevent any further execution until the issue is resolved. By pausing the contract, the owner can effectively protect user funds and prevent any malicious activity from occurring.

However, it is worth noting that when a condition triggers the pause state for the router, which is expected to handle the majority of interactions, there is a potential bypass route. This bypass involves directly calling functions within the ArrakisV2 contract, effectively circumventing the pause condition and allowing users to interact with the protocol despite the ongoing pause state.

```js
File: ArrakisV2Router.sol
50:     function addLiquidity(AddLiquidityData memory params_)
51:         external
52:         payable
53:         whenNotPaused
54:         nonReentrant
```

For example, the `addLiquidity` in condition `gauge_` == address(0), it is possible to directly call ArrakisV2:mint() function which has the same effect, thus the `whenNotPaused` modifier in the `addLiquidity` will not be respected.

More over, the remove liquidity also open for this issue

```js
File: ArrakisV2Router.sol
201:     function removeLiquidity(RemoveLiquidityData memory params_)
202:         external
203:         whenNotPaused
204:         nonReentrant
205:         returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
```

which the `removeLiquidity` when the gauge address is ZERO, user can bypass it by `burning` directly from ArrakisV2.

## Impact

The bypassing of the `whenNotPaused` condition can lead to unexpected behaviors when the `pause` condition is in effect, depending on the specific reason for the pause state. For example if there is vulnerability in the contract and an attacker bypasses the pause state, they can continue executing transactions and potentially exploit the market / accounting. This can lead to financial losses for users, disruption of the application's functionality, and damage to the overall trust in the system.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement the pause state / modifier in the ArrakisV2 vault, or prevent any direct call to ArrakisV2, force the call only through Router
