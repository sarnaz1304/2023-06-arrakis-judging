# Malicious users can bypass protocol pause to add or remove liquidity

## Summary
Malicious users can bypass protocol pause to add or remove liquidity.
## Vulnerability Detail
In ArraksiV2Router.sol, protocol pause is implemented through a modifier `whenNotPaused()`.
```solidity
//ArrakisV2Router.sol-addliquidity()
   function addLiquidity(
        AddLiquidityData memory params_
    )
        external
        payable
 >>>    whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1, uint256 sharesReceived)
    {...
```
```solidity
//ArrakisV2Router.sol-addliquidity()
 function removeLiquidity(
        RemoveLiquidityData memory params_
    )
        external
>>>     whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
    {..
```
But a malicious actor can bypass this modifier by interacting with the core ArrakisV2.sol to mint or burn liquidity and receive profits because there is no pause mechanism implemented in the core contract.
## Impact
Users can still mint and burn liquidity during pause, which is unsafe to the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In ArrakisV2.sol, implement a check to query protocol pausing state from the router contract in key functions such as `mint()` and `burn()`. This will ensure that when the protocol is paused on the router, any attempt to mint and burn through the core vault contract will be reverted.
