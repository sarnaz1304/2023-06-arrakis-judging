# Missing slippage parameter in mints all over code


## Summary

Missing slippage parameter while minting makes it vulnerable to front-run attacks and exposes users to unwanted slippage.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementation of minting functions or it sister functions lack a parameter for controlling slippage, which makes them vulnerable to front-run attacks. Transactions involving large volumes are particularly at risk, as the minting process can be manipulated, resulting in price impact.

## Impact

Users exposed to uncontrolable slippage risks
