# SimpleManager doesn't have ability to change oracle

## Summary
SimpleManager doesn't have ability to change oracle.
## Vulnerability Detail
When new vault is initialized, [then oracle is set for it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-manager-templates/contracts/SimpleManager.sol#L108).
This oracle is used to check deviation and slippage.

The problem is that currently there is no ability to change oracle for the vault and because of that in case if oracle will stop working, manager doesn't have ability to replace it. As result minting liquidity and swapping will be blocked.
## Impact
minting liquidity and swapping will be blocked
