# ArrakisV2 vault addresses are not deterministic and cannot be computed from the salt

## Summary
When deploying ArrakisV2 vaults, construction arguments are passed together with the usage of the CREATE2 opcode, which makes it impossible to compute the address of a vault only knowing the salt.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a vault is [deployed via `BeaconProxy` or `TransparentUpgradeableProxy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2Factory.sol#L115-L129), its address is computed using the CREATE2 opcode to make vault addresses deterministic and recoverable from a salt. However, constructor arguments are passed along with the vault deployment, breaking the deterministic feature. In EVM, [constructor arguments are part of contract's init code](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/76335), and as per [EIP-1014](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014), the init code of a contract is used in a CREATE2 address computation. Thus, when passing constructor arguments to a contract deployed via CREATE2, the salt alone cannot be used to recreate the address of the deployed contract or pre-compute it in advance.
## Impact
ArrakisV2 vault addresses cannot be re-computed from third-party contracts or off-chain applications (i.e. an SDK) knowing only the information that identifies a vault uniquely (i.e. `tx.origin`, deployment block number, and the `initialize` call parameters).
## Code Snippet
[ArrakisV2Factory.sol#L115-L129](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2Factory.sol#L115-L129):
```solidity
bytes32 salt = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(tx.origin, block.number, data)
);

vault = isBeacon_
    ? address(
        new BeaconProxy{salt: salt}(address(arrakisV2Beacon), data)
    )
    : address(
        new TransparentUpgradeableProxy{salt: salt}(
            arrakisV2Beacon.implementation(),
            address(this),
            data
        )
    );
```

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider passing the constructor arguments via a storage variable of the factory contract. For reference, consider the implementation in Uniswap V3:
1. constructor arguments are set to a storage variable before deployment, and the variable is cleared after deployment: [UniswapV3PoolDeployer.sol#L34-L36](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3PoolDeployer.sol#L34-L36);
1. in the pool's constructor, the parameters are read from the factory: [UniswapV3Pool.sol#L119](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L119).
