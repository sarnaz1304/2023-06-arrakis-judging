# Uniswap swaps don't have a deadline check

## Summary

Users who swap through the router can be exploited by a sandwich attack. They may receive less than expected because tokens have been sold at an outdated price.

## Vulnerability Detail

The inclusion of a transaction expiration check provides a safeguard for users against swapping tokens at a price that is lower than the current market price, but there are checks only for slippage and not for a deadline, so users can be sandwiched:

```solidity
require(sharesReceived > 0, "nothing to mint");
require(
    amount0 >= params_.addData.amount0Min &&
        amount1 >= params_.addData.amount1Min &&
        sharesReceived >= params_.addData.amountSharesMin,
    "below min amounts"
);
```

Let's consider the following scenario:

1. A user calls any swap function, for example `swapAndAddLiquidity`
2. Prior to the mining of this transaction, there is a sudden surge in gas costs. As a result, the transaction remains in the mempool for a period of time because the gas cost paid by the transaction is lower than the current gas price
3. While the transaction is in the mempool, the price of the token increases
4. Subsequently, the gas cost decreases, and the transaction is eventually mined. However, due to the outdated token price on which the calculation, which is now lower than the current price, the swapping process becomes susceptible to sandwiching by an MEV bot. This bot reduces the price of the token in the Uniswap pool, ensuring that the minimum output amount check is still met. By exploiting the swapping occurring at the lower price, the bot earns a profit.
5. Due to the sandwich attack, the tokens are swapped at a price that is outdated and lower than the current market price of the tokens.


## Impact

Medium, users may receive less funds than expected because tokens have been swapped at an outdated price.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a `deadline` parameter to `SwapAndAddData`, and revert the transaction when `block.timestamp > deadline`.
