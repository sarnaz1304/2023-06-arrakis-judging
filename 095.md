# ArrakisV2Storage.setManagerFeeBPS should collect fees before changing fee

## Summary
ArrakisV2Storage.setManagerFeeBPS should collect fees before changing fee.
## Vulnerability Detail
`ArrakisV2Storage.setManagerFeeBPS` allows manager to change fee that he receives from earned uniswap fees.
The problem is that this function is allowed to be called anytime and it doesn't accrue fees that are accumulated in the uniswap.

As result, new rate will be applied for the fees that were earned earlier, which can be a big loss for all stakers and big prize for a manager.
I believe that this is high rather then medium, because this is not just loss of yields for 1 staker, this is loss of yields for all stakers at same time.
## Impact
All stakers loss part of earned yields.
