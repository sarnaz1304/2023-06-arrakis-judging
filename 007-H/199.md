# Extra ether sent to ```ArrakisV2Router#addLiquidityPermit2()``` is not properly refunded

## Summary
The ```addLiquidityPermit2()``` function does not update the ```isToken0Weth``` value which is initiated to ```false```. This variable is used later on in the function to refund excess ETH sent to the function. If ```token0``` is actually WETH then the refunded ETH value will be incorrect, leading to the funds being lost.
## Vulnerability Detail
The ```isToken0Weth``` variable is used in multiple functions inside the router to store the return value of ```ArrakisV2Router#_wrapEth```. Consider the case where ```token0``` is WETH and ```addLiquidityPermit2()``` is called for the WETH/USDT pool. 

Alice sends an excess of 10000 ETH with the desire to deposit 1 WETH into the pool and 2000 USDT.
1 ETH will be wrapped into WETH and will be deposited along with 2000 USDT
The following code will be reached and the ```else if``` branch will be taken even though ```token0``` is actually WETH.
The refund amount will be calculated as 10000e18-2000e18 = 8000 ETH when it should actually be 9999 ETH. In this exaggerated example the user loses 1999 ether.
```solidity
    function addLiquidityPermit2(AddLiquidityPermit2Data memory params_)
        external
        payable
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (
            uint256 amount0,
            uint256 amount1,
            uint256 sharesReceived
        )
    {
 
         //..

         bool isToken0Weth;
        
         //..
        
         if (msg.value > 0) {
            if (isToken0Weth && msg.value > amount0) {
                payable(msg.sender).sendValue(msg.value - amount0);
            } else if (!isToken0Weth && msg.value > amount1) {
                //@audit this code will be executed
                payable(msg.sender).sendValue(msg.value - amount1);
            }
        }
    }
```


## Impact
Alice will not be properly refunded additional ETH sent to the contract that was not converted to WETH.

## Recommendation
Ensure that the ```isToken0Weth``` variable is set properly in the case that ```token0``` is WETH
