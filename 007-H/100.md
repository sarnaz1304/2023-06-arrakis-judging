# ArakkisV2Router.addLiquidityPermit2 eth refund logic is not working

## Summary
ArakkisV2Router.addLiquidityPermit2 eth refund logic is not working, because `isToken0Weth` param is not set.
## Vulnerability Detail
It's allowed for user to provide payment in native token to `ArakkisV2Router.addLiquidityPermit2` function. It's possible that user paid more, then needed, so [this amount should be returned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-periphery/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L292-L298).
But because `isToken0Weth` variable is not set to correct value this function will not be able to correctly handle refund.
## Impact
Refund logic is not correct
