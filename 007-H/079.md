# Use of non-initialized `isToken0Weth`

## Summary
In `ArrakisV2Router.sol`, in `addLiquidityPermit2` function `isToken0Weth` is used before it's initialized.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/ArrakisFinance/v2-periphery/blob/ee6d7c5f3ffb212887db4ec0e595618ea418070f/contracts/ArrakisV2Router.sol#L278-L298

There is no assignment logic for `isToken0Weth`, and it's used to send remaining ETH amount to the sender, which is always false.

## Impact
Since `isToken0Weth` is always false, the router can send wrong amount of ETH or would fail if there isn't enough amount.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Initialize `isToken0Weth` using internal `_isToken0Weth` function.
