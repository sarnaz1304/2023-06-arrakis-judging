# A user can front run setRestrictedMint to be the first minter

## Summary
A user can front run setRestrictedMint to be the first minter 

## Vulnerability Detail
During a public vault setup, a vault is created by calling deployVault on ArrakisV2Factory:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2Factory.sol#L34-L41

and then calling setRestrictedMint on the vault instance:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L227-L230

During the time between the two transactions, the initial minting is open to anybody, since restrictedMint == 0 allows to mint:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L61

Although this can be mitigated by specifics in the deployment process, this attack could have been possible on deployments previously made, see:

## Impact
A user who is able to call the mint function right after a vault is deployed, and before restricted mint is set can bypass various checks such as `supplyCap`:

## Recommendation
Either:
- Use a restrictive value by default (set restrictedMint to address(1) by default, and allowing the owner to explicitely set it to open)
- Allow the factory to set this value during initialization
