# Front run may prevent some ranges from being removed timely

## Summary
A front run can be used to prevent an operator from removing univ3 ranges when executing rebalancing.

## Vulnerability Detail
As we can see in the rebalance function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L287-L296

A range would be removed only if all of its liquidity is removed.

The mechanism suggested in `standardRebalance`, seems to be to remove all of the ranges at the start of a rebalance (and reintroduce them during the mints):
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2Resolver.sol#L71-L106

However since the burns are defined using the exact liquidity evaluated at that moment in the univ3 range, a user can frontrun the rebalance transaction by the operator to deposit `dust` to the existing ranges and prevent their removal.

This could cause an overaccumulation of positions, and eventually help to cause DOS because the `_ranges` array would grow unboundedly.

## Impact
A front-run of the rebalance transaction can cause `_ranges` to not be removed timely

## Recommendation
Use type(uint).max for the burns quantity instead of fetching the exact liquidity amount from pools
