# Changing manager fee BPS affects past shares conversion rates, making users lose a portion of rewards or getting extra rewards

## Summary
When minting shares, the manager fee BPS is applied to pending Uniswap swap fees; the manager fee BPS is applied to actual amounts when burning. Thus, changing the manager fee BPS before burning will impact the shares-to-assets conversion rate of the past mintings. Some users may receive more shares than expected, leading to an increased amount of underlying assets for them; other users will be damaged of course, since they'll be eligible for a smaller share of underlying assets.
## Vulnerability Detail
[When minting shares](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L54), the total underlying assets are computed using the [Underlying.totalUnderlyingForMint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol#L27) function. The function fetches accumulated and pending fees from the underlying Uniswap V3 pools ([Underlying.sol#L59-L60](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol#L59-L60)) and then subtracts the manager portion from the fees ([Underlying.sol#L66-L70](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol#L66-L70)) without collecting the fees and locking the manager's portion (i.e. `_applyFees` is not called). However, the manager portion can be changed at any moment via the [SimpleManager.setManagerFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-manager-templates/contracts/SimpleManager.sol#L259-L273) function. Since, during minting, manager fees are subtracted from swap fees that haven't been collected yet, the actual amount of manager fees subtracted after a swap fees collection can be different, due to a different value of the manager fee BPS.

Consider this example scenario:
1. The current manager fee is 5%.
1. Alice mints shares in a vault, the 5% manager fee is subtracted ([Underlying.sol#L66-L70](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol#L66-L70)) from **pending** Uniswap swap fees (the swap fees are not collected at this point).
1. `ArrakisV2.burn` or `ArrakisV2.rebalance` is called, pending Uniswap swap fees are collected ([ArrakisV2.sol#L433-L442](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L433-L442)), and actual manager fee amounts are recorded ([ArrakisV2.sol#L446-L448](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L446-L448)). At this point, everything is correct: the 5% fee was applied both during the minting of shares and the collecting of fees.
1. Bob mints shares in the same vault, the 5% manager fee is subtracted from pending swap fees.
1. The owner of the vault changes the manager fee to 20%.
1. `ArrakisV2.burn` or `ArrakisV2.rebalance` is called, swap fees are collected, the 20% manager fee is subtracted, and the actual manager fee amounts are recorded. At this point, Bob holds less shares than expected because the actual manager fee is 20%, not 5%: the manager fee that was subtracted from collected swap fees is 20%, not 5%; but the Bob's shares amount was calculated at 5% manger fees.
## Impact
Users can receive miscalculated amounts of shares when the manager fee BPS changed. Some users can receive more shares than expected, letting them withdraw more assets from a vault that expected. Other users can be eligible for less assets than expected. Anyone who mints shares before or after a manager fee change and before a collection and application of fees is affected.
## Code Snippet
1. `UnderlyingHelper.totalUnderlyingForMint` is called when minting shares:
[ArrakisV2.sol#L68](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L68)
1. In the function, pending Uniswap swap fees are fetched using the `underlyingMint` function:
[Underlying.sol#L48-L60](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol#L48-L60)
1. The manager fee is applied to the pending swap fees: this is done in memory, `subtractAdminFees` doesn't record actual fee amounts:
[Underlying.sol#L66-L70](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol#L66-L70)
[Underlying.sol#L350-L351](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol#L350-L351)
1. The pending manager fees are not included in the calculation of the amounts of tokens to deposit:
[Underlying.sol#L482-L493](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/libraries/Underlying.sol#L482-L493)
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider collecting all pending swap fees from all underlying Uniswap pools when changing the manager fee BPS variable:
1. In [ArrakisV2Storage.setManagerFeeBPS](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/abstract/ArrakisV2Storage.sol#L218), consider calling `UniswapV3Pool.burn` with 0 liquidity (the third argument of the function) on all underlying Uniswap pools of a vault (for reference, this is what Uniswap's position manager does: [NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L328-L367](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/NonfungiblePositionManager.sol#L328-L367)).
1. Then, consider calling `UniswapV3Pool.collect` on all underlying pools and calculating the fee amounts collected (similarly to how `_withdraw` does it).
1. Finally, consider updating the `managerBalance0` and `managerBalance1` variables.

Basically, this is identical to calling `ArrakisV2._withdraw` (with the `liquidity_` argument set to 0) and `ArrakisV2._applyFees`.
