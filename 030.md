# Min deposit protection during rebalancing can be bypassed if multiple fee tiers

## Summary
Arrakis vault implements a slippage protection during rebalancing, but it does not protect when multiple feeTiers are used.

## Vulnerability Detail
The slippage protection used here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-core/contracts/ArrakisV2.sol#L408-L409

can be used to check that liquidity is added around a given price (acts like a slippage protection), when used on one pool.

However when aggregated on multiple pools as it is done here (over same tokens but multiple fee tiers), it does not protect the user, as pools can be imbalanced in different directions, and funds can be provided in the same proportion but provide liquidity at a worse price,

Example:

Arrakis vault handles the price range 1200-2000 on WETH-USDC in fee tiers [0.3%, 0.5%], price of WETH sits at 1600.

Alice sees that Bob the operator tries to rebalance the pool and thus provides liquidity on both ranges

Alice front runs Bob transaction, driving the price of WETH-USDC on fee tier 0.3% to 1200, and on fee tier 0.5% to 2000.

Bob executes his operation, and provides bigger amounts of WETH and USDC to provide same liquidity (worse prices), and so the slippage checks out.

Alice back runs the operation and makes a nice profit.

Please note that in the setup using `SimpleManager`, price deviation is checked on every minting pool:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-arrakis/blob/main/v2-manager-templates/contracts/SimpleManager.sol#L189-L194

So the sandwiching is limited by the deviation parameter (1%). This issue still holds, since maybe Bob wanted to enforce a stricter deviation for his rebalance (0.5%) using this check, and fails to do so.

## Impact
Bob makes an unfortunate rebalance to the profit of a sandwich.

## Recommendation
Check deposited amounts in aggregate but grouped by fee tiers.
