# Liquidity Withdrawal Vulnerability

## Summary

An issue was discovered in the `standardRebalance` function of the `ArrakisV2Resolver` contract. Specifically, the contract does not properly handle the liquidation of positions under specific market conditions. This might potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the market conditions and cause the contract to burn more liquidity than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `standardRebalance` function in `ArrakisV2Resolver` is designed to adjust the positions according to the market conditions. It burns the liquidity of the existing positions and mints new liquidity in other positions. This process is implemented based on the `RangeWeight` parameter, which represents the weight of liquidity to be added in each position. However, there is a logic flaw in the calculation of the new liquidity to be minted.

```solidity
    for (uint256 i; i < rangeWeights_.length; i++) {
        RangeWeight memory rangeWeight = rangeWeights_[i];
        (uint160 sqrtPriceX96, , , , , , ) = IUniswapV3Pool(
            factory.getPool(
                token0Addr,
                token1Addr,
                rangeWeight.range.feeTier
            )
        ).slot0();

        uint128 liquidity = LiquidityAmounts.getLiquidityForAmounts(
            sqrtPriceX96,
            TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(rangeWeight.range.lowerTick),
            TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(rangeWeight.range.upperTick),
            FullMath.mulDiv(amount0, rangeWeight.weight, hundredPercent),
            FullMath.mulDiv(amount1, rangeWeight.weight, hundredPercent)
        );

        rebalanceParams.mints[i] = PositionLiquidity({
            liquidity: liquidity,
            range: rangeWeight.range
        });
    }
```
In the above code snippet, the contract calculates the liquidity to be minted based on the current price and the range ticks. However, it does not take into account the liquidity currently being burned. As a result, when the price fluctuates significantly, the contract could potentially burn more liquidity than mint, leading to a loss of funds.

## Impact

An attacker could potentially manipulate the price of the underlying tokens and cause the `ArrakisV2Resolver` contract to burn more liquidity than it mints. This could result in significant financial loss for the liquidity providers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A potential fix for this issue is to adjust the calculation of the new liquidity to be minted. The contract should take into account the liquidity currently being burned and the price fluctuation. This could be implemented by adding additional checks in the `standardRebalance` function.

## Proof Of Concept

1. Deploy the `ArrakisV2Resolver` contract and a `IArrakisV2` contract.
2. Initialize the `ArrakisV2Resolver` contract with the `IArrakisV2` contract's address.
3. Add liquidity to the `IArrakisV2` contract.
4. Manipulate the price of the underlying tokens to cause significant price fluctuation.
5. Call the `standardRebalance` function of the `ArrakisV2Resolver` contract.
6. Observe that the `ArrakisV2Resolver` contract burns more liquidity than it mints, resulting in a loss of funds.
