# XO-`Type error` caused in `ArrakisV2` contract can lead to  loss of funds

## Summary
- there is a problem is a type error that could cause a loss of funds. it's occurs when the `uint128 liquidityToWithdraw` variable is assigned the value `type(uint128).max` if `rebalanceParams_.burns[i].liquidity` is equal to `type(uint128).max`, the withdraw variable is a `uint128` variable, so it cannot be assigned a value that is larger than `2**128 - 1`. This will cause the code to fail at runtime.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
uint128 liquidityToWithdraw;

if (rebalanceParams_.burns[i].liquidity == type(uint128).max)
    liquidityToWithdraw = liquidity;
else liquidityToWithdraw = rebalanceParams_.burns[i].liquidity;
```
- the value `type(uint128).max`  assigns to the `liquidityToWithdraw` variable if `rebalanceParams_.burns[i].liquidity` is equal to `type(uint128).max.` the withdraw variable is a `uint128` variable, so it cannot be assigned a value that is larger than `2**128 - 1`. This will cause the code to fail at runtime.
- if someone is able to set `rebalanceParams_.burns[i].liquidity` to `type(uint128).max,` then the withdraw variable will be assigned a value that is too large, and the code will fail. This could result in the loss of funds for the user who is trying to withdraw their liquidity.
## Impact

```solidity
contract ArrakisV2 {

function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {

uint128 liquidityToWithdraw;

if (rebalanceParams_.burns[0].liquidity == type(uint128).max)
    liquidityToWithdraw = type(uint128).max;
else liquidityToWithdraw = rebalanceParams_.burns[0].liquidity;

withdraw(liquidityToWithdraw);

}
}
```
- this poc will cause the `withdraw` function to fail at runtime, because the value of `liquidityToWithdraw` is too large.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- ensure that the value of `liquidityToWithdraw` is never greater than `2**128 - 1`, this will prevent the code from failing at runtime.
