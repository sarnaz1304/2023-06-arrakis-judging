# Vault supply cap can be bypassed

## Summary
When a vault has a supply cap, this is implemented in ArrakisV2Router.sol instead of the vault core contract, which makes the vault vulnerable for attacker bypassing restriction by interacting directly with ArrakisV2.sol.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user add liquidity through ArrakisV2Router.sol. The vault supply cap is checked in `_addLiquidity()`, which check minting rules in mapping variable `mintRestrictedVaultes` from ArrakisV2RouterStorage.sol.
```solidity
//ArrakisV2Router.sol - _addLiquidity()
...
            MintRules memory mintRules = mintRestrictedVaults[vault_];
            if (mintRules.supplyCap > 0) {
                require(
                    IArrakisV2(vault_).totalSupply() + mintAmount_ <=
                        mintRules.supplyCap,
                    "above supply cap"
                );
            }
...
```
However, this require statement can be easily bypassed by a malicious user who interacts directly with ArrakisV2.sol `mint()`, where no vault specific minting rules are stored, and neither is a cap of `totalSupply()` checked.

## Impact
A malicious user can bypass the supply cap by interacting directly with ArrakisV2.sol. This makes a vault and manager take on a bigger risk than what they are willing to take. And the user can still implement slippage control offered by ArrakisV2Router.sol in a malicious contract during the attack.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement `supplyCap` variable in ArrakisV2.sol and allow the owner to set `supplyCap` directly on the vault core storage. And enforce supplyCap check in `mint()`.
