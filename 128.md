# if (sqrtRatioAX96 > sqrtRatioBX96) in Underlying.sol#getAmountsForDelta() it should revert

## Summary
if `(sqrtRatioAX96 > sqrtRatioBX96)` in `Underlying.sol#getAmountsForDelta()` it means either a lot of calculations has been made for a bad order of the range we are using AND a range has been added without respecting the order so it should not just inverse the side like it's done currently : 
```solidity
 if (sqrtRatioAX96 > sqrtRatioBX96)
            (sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96) = (sqrtRatioBX96, sqrtRatioAX96); //E @audit-issue should revert been already checked
```
but simply **revert** 

## Vulnerability Detail
`Underlying.sol#getAmountsForDelta()` is called within a process I will try to describe : 

1. `totalUnderlyingForMint()` is called from ArrakisV2Resolver.sol to calculate how much underlying tokens(token0 and token1) a user need to deposit to be minted a specific amount of shares
2. `getUnderlyingBalancesMint()` is called in Underlying.sol to get amount of token0 and token1 and fees associated with minting shares
3. `getAmountsForDelta()` is finally called with a purpose of returning amount of token0 and token1 that a certain liquidity amount represents in a specific price range

During this process `_getFeesEarned()` is called to computes fees earned or computes fees that could be earned if we mint a certain amount of liquidity.
This function is called with a struct argument GetFeesPayload : 
```solidity
(fee0, fee1) = _getFeesEarned(
                GetFeesPayload({
                    feeGrowthInside0Last: feeGrowthInside0Last,
                    feeGrowthInside1Last: feeGrowthInside1Last,
                    pool: positionUnderlying_.pool,
                    liquidity: liquidity,
                    tick: positionUnderlying_.tick,
                    lowerTick: positionUnderlying_.lowerTick,
                    upperTick: positionUnderlying_.upperTick
                })
            );
```
so this function use the positionUnderlying.lowerTick and `positionUnderlying.upperTick` to computes fees and does not check whether lowerTick is < than upperTick , it trust the parameter of the function

In `getAmountsForDelta` otherwise there this check : 
```solidity
 if (sqrtRatioAX96 > sqrtRatioBX96)
            (sqrtRatioAX96, sqrtRatioBX96) = (sqrtRatioBX96, sqrtRatioAX96); //E @audit-issue should revert been already checked
```
where 
`sqrtRatioAX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(positionUnderlying_.lowerTick)``
and
`sqrtRatioBX96 = TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(positionUnderlying_.upperTick)`

This returns amount of token0 and token1 that a certain liquidity amount represents in a specific price range but if sqrtRatioAX96 > sqrtRatioBX96 it means that the ticks are inversed and in `_getFeesEarned()` we computed the fees for a bad order of ranges which would result in 0 fee 
so the function `getAmountsForDelta` should revert if we have : `sqrtRatioAX96 > sqrtRatioBX96`

## Impact
If for in certains conditions,sqrtRatioAX96 > sqrtRatioBX96 is true in this function, it means a critical error (bad calculation of fees) could pass silently and introduce another critical error(bad order of lower and upper ticks in a saved range) without reverting
