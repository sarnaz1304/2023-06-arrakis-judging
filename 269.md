# there should be a mechanism to account for any excess tokens after the minting process


## Summary

This report identifies a critical vulnerability related to the management of excessive token amounts within Direct Deposit and Mint function calls. The current code implementation does not provide an adequate process to handle residual token amounts following the liquidity pool (LP) tokens minting process. As a result, any excess tokens not used during minting may become trapped within the contract, rendering them unusable and causing potential token loss for users. Implementing a robust mechanism to effectively manage this excess is crucial to ensure the integrity and functionality of the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    // transfer amounts owed to contract
        if (amount0 > 0) {
            token0.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, me, amount0);
        }
        if (amount1 > 0) {
            token1.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, me, amount1);
        }

        if (isTotalSupplyGtZero) {
            for (uint256 i; i < _ranges.length; i++) {
                Range memory range = _ranges[i];
                IUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(
                    factory.getPool(
                        address(token0),
                        address(token1),
                        range.feeTier
                    )
                );
                uint128 liquidity = Position.getLiquidityByRange(
                    pool,
                    me,
                    range.lowerTick,
                    range.upperTick
                );
                if (liquidity == 0) continue;

                liquidity = SafeCast.toUint128(
                    FullMath.mulDiv(liquidity, mintAmount_, ts)
                );

                pool.mint(me, range.lowerTick, range.upperTick, liquidity, "");
            }
        }

```

The mint procedure initiates the creation of liquidity pool (LP) tokens based on the prevailing market price within a designated tick range. Detailed documentation on this method can be accessed in the official UniswapV3 contract documentation here.

To provide some context, the UniswapV3 documentation explicitly states:

"The caller of this method receives a callback in the form of IUniswapV3MintCallback#uniswapV3MintCallback in which they must pay any token0 or token1 owed for the liquidity. The amount of token0/token1 due depends on tickLower, tickUpper, the amount of liquidity, and the current price."

This means that the volume of token0 and token1 required is intrinsically tied to the current price, as further illustrated in the UniswapV3Pool contract. Thus, when the mint method is called, it simultaneously calls the modify position method.

The token amount requirement manifests differently under three distinct scenarios:

.- If the current tick is less than the tickLower, more of token0 is needed as its value is increasing.

_slot0.tick < params.tickLower)

 if (_slot0.tick < params.tickLower) {
	// current tick is below the passed range; liquidity can only become in range by crossing from left to
	// right, when we'll need _more_ token0 (it's becoming more valuable) so user must provide it
	amount0 = SqrtPriceMath.getAmount0Delta(
		TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(params.tickLower),
		TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(params.tickUpper),
		params.liquidityDelta
	);
}
-. If the current tick falls within the tick range, the required amounts of token0 and token1 are contingent upon the price and tick range. In this case, not all of the amount0Desired and amount1Desired may be utilized, leaving some tokens remaining.

_slot0.tick < params.tickUpper

 // current tick is inside the passed range
                uint128 liquidityBefore = liquidity; // SLOAD for gas optimization

                // write an oracle entry
                (slot0.observationIndex, slot0.observationCardinality) = observations.write(
                    _slot0.observationIndex,
                    _blockTimestamp(),
                    _slot0.tick,
                    liquidityBefore,
                    _slot0.observationCardinality,
                    _slot0.observationCardinalityNext
                );

                amount0 = SqrtPriceMath.getAmount0Delta(
                    _slot0.sqrtPriceX96,
                    TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(params.tickUpper),
                    params.liquidityDelta
                );
                amount1 = SqrtPriceMath.getAmount1Delta(
                    TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(params.tickLower),
                    _slot0.sqrtPriceX96,
                    params.liquidityDelta
                );

                liquidity = LiquidityMath.addDelta(liquidityBefore, params.liquidityDelta);
            }
An example scenario is if 100 USDC is transferred as amount0Desired, and only 90 USDC is used for LP minting, the remaining 10 USDC is stranded.

-. If the current tick surpasses the tick range, more of token1 is needed as it is gaining value.

current tick is above the passed range

// current tick is above the passed range; liquidity can only become in range by crossing from right to
// left, when we'll need _more_ token1 (it's becoming more valuable) so user must provide it
amount1 = SqrtPriceMath.getAmount1Delta(
	TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(params.tickLower),
	TickMath.getSqrtRatioAtTick(params.tickUpper),
	params.liquidityDelta
);

## Impact

In the existing protocol, the excess amount of token0 and token1 is neither refunded to the user nor utilized to mint additional liquidity. Consequently, these residual tokens get trapped within the contract. This lack of an efficient process to handle the unused tokens results in unnecessary token wastage.
